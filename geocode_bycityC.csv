MORE THAN ONE-QUARTER OF ALL STEM JOBS ARE HELD BY WORKERS WITH EITHER AN ASSOCIATE?S DEGREE OR SOME OTHER SUB-BACCALAUREATE TRAINING. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF THE STEM WORKFORCE, AS THEY OFTEN SERVE STUDENTS FROM POPULATIONS UNDERREPRESENTED IN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN STEM FIELDS OF STUDY. UNFORTUNATELY, APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF INCOMING COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE CONSIDERED NOT READY TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE-LEVEL MATHEMATICS. HISTORICALLY, SUCH STUDENTS HAVE BEEN UNLIKELY TO EVER COMPLETE A STEM DEGREE. TRADITIONALLY, STUDENTS DEEMED NOT READY FOR COLLEGE MATHEMATICS MUST ENROLL IN PREREQUISITE DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION (DE), WHICH REQUIRES STUDENTS TO PAY FOR AND COMPLETE A SEQUENCE OF NONCREDIT-BEARING COURSES BEFORE ENROLLING IN CREDIT-BEARING COLLEGE COURSES. MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PREREQUISITE DE IS INEFFECTIVE AND COULD EVEN BE HARMFUL. THIS PROJECT EXAMINES A STATEWIDE REFORM IN THE KENTUCKY COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM (KCTCS), WHICH REPLACED TRADITIONAL PREREQUISITE DE WITH CO-REQUISITE DE. IN THIS INCREASINGLY POPULAR DE MODEL ACADEMICALLY UNDER-PREPARED STUDENTS ENROLL DIRECTLY IN A CREDIT-BEARING, COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSE PAIRED WITH DEVELOPMENTAL SUPPORT. THE KCTCS REFORM HAS TWO DISTINCT FEATURES. FIRST, IT MAKES COLLEGE MATHEMATICS COURSES ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS WITH A WIDER RANGE OF INITIAL MATHEMATICS SKILLS; AND SECOND, IT INCORPORATES HIGH SCHOOL GRADES, INSTEAD OF JUST STANDARDIZED TEST RESULTS, AS AN ADDITIONAL INDICATOR DETERMINING WHETHER A STUDENT IS ELIGIBLE TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE MATHEMATICS. THE STUDY WILL ADDRESS THREE IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS RELATED TO HOW CO-REQUISITE DE SUPPORTS UNDER-PREPARED STUDENTS BY: I) STUDYING STUDENTS CLOSE TO BEING COLLEGE READY, II) COMPARING CO-REQUISITE DE RELATIVE TO NO DE, AND III) THROUGH USING HIGH SCHOOL GRADES IN PLACE OF TEST SCORES FOR DETERMINING COLLEGE PLACEMENT. THE PRIMARY STUDY SAMPLE CONSISTS OF STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE 16 CAMPUSES THAT CONSTITUTE KCTCS. THE PROJECT WILL MERGE SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY RECORDS FROM ALL STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND ALL STUDENTS IN IN-STATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS. THE PRIMARY IMPACT ANALYSIS SAMPLE WILL INCLUDE ALL FIRST-TIME STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A KCTCS DEGREE PROGRAM WHO HAVE RECENT ACT SCORES. THERE WILL BE FIVE COHORTS OF FIRST YEAR STUDENTS FOLLOWED FOR THREE YEARS. THE GOAL OF THE CO-REQUISITE REFORM IS TO INCREASE THE COMPLETION RATE OF GATEKEEPER MATHEMATICS COURSES. THE PRIMARY MEASURE WILL BE WHETHER A STUDENT COMPLETES A GATEKEEPER MATHEMATICS COURSE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF INITIAL ENROLLMENT. THE PROJECT ALSO ENTAILS MEASURING LONGER-TERM PROGRESS TOWARDS KEY OUTCOMES SUCH AS PERSISTING TO A SECOND YEAR OF ENROLLMENT, CREDIT ACCUMULATION, AND DEGREE COMPLETION OR SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION WITHIN THREE YEARS OF INITIAL ENROLLMENT. THE PRIMARY METHOD OF ANALYSIS WILL BE USING CUT SCORES OF BOTH ACT MATHEMATICS SCORES AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADES IN ORDER TO CONDUCT REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS THAT COMPARE STUDENTS WHO ARE JUST ABOVE THE DE PLACEMENT THRESHOLDS TO THOSE ARE JUST BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THE ANALYSIS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA, THE PROJECT WILL FEATURE ORIGINAL DATA COLLECTION IN ORDER TO BOLSTER KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE REFORM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND ITS ASSOCIATED COSTS. THIS COMPONENT WILL BEGIN WITH TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WITH ASSESSMENT AND PLACEMENT DIRECTORS IN EACH OF THE 16 KCTCS COLLEGES. GUIDED BY ADMINISTRATOR RESPONSES, THE PROJECT WILL NEXT SURVEY INSTRUCTORS WHO PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT OR COLLEGE-LEVEL INSTRUCTION IN MATHEMATICS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL INVESTIGATE IMPLEMENTATION ATTRIBUTES AND COLLEGE RESPONSES TO THE CO-REQUISITE REFORM ALONG DIMENSIONS SUCH AS SUPPORT STRUCTURE, INSTRUCTOR ASSIGNMENT, AND STUDENT COMPOSITION. THIS PROJECT IS SUPPORTED BY NSF'S EHR CORE RESEARCH (ECR) PROGRAM. THE ECR PROGRAM EMPHASIZES FUNDAMENTAL STEM EDUCATION RESEARCH THAT GENERATES FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD. INVESTMENTS ARE MADE IN CRITICAL AREAS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL, BROAD AND ENDURING: STEM LEARNING AND STEM LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN STEM, AND STEM WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

ONE SUCH SENSOR IS AN ENZYME KNOWN AS IRE1, WHICH CAN MONITOR PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN THE CELL, AND SIGNAL WHEN PROTEINS ARE NOT BEING MADE PROPERLY. DEFECTS IN THE REGULATION OF THE IRE1 SENSOR HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN SEVERAL HUMAN DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER, DIABETES, AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING NEW WAYS TO REGULATE THIS VITAL SENSOR COULD LEAD TO INNOVATIVE DESIGNS OF NEW THERAPEUTICS. IRE1 MAINTAINS PROTEIN QUALITY CONTROL USING TWO DISTINCT FUNCTIONS THAT EITHER DESTROYS OR EDITS THE MOLECULAR INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED TO BUILD PROTEINS. THESE TWO FUNCTIONS HAVE EVOLVED AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THIS ENZYME. WHILE IRE1 FROM MAMMALS PERFORMS BOTH FUNCTIONS, THE IRE1 FROM MICROORGANISMS, SUCH AS YEAST, EXCLUSIVELY PERFORMS ONLY ONE FUNCTION. THIS BEGS THE QUESTION: WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF IRE1 ? DESTRUCTION OR EDITING? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE IRE1 SENSOR USING GENETIC AND BIOINFORMATIC APPROACHES TO CHARACTERIZE THE FUNCTION OF THE IRE1 IN AMOEBA, WHICH SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR WITH MAMMALS AND YEAST. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES WHETHER IRE1 ALSO FUNCTIONS AS AN ANCIENT CELLULAR DEFENSE AGAINST HARMFUL BACTERIA. THIS RESEARCH IS DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE INTO A COURSE-BASED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE (CURE) AND PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN BIOLOGY TO TRAIN AND DIVERSIFY THE FUTURE STEM WORKFORCE. INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME 1 (IRE1) IS A HIGHLY CONSERVED STRESS SENSOR IN EUKARYOTIC CELLS THAT CAN DETECT THE ACCUMULATION OF MISFOLDED PROTEINS IN THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER). IRE1 MAINTAINS PROTEIN QUALITY CONTROL IN THE ER USING TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT RIBONUCLEASE (RNASE) ACTIVITIES: MRNA DEGRADATION AND MRNA SPLICING. WHILE MAMMALIAN IRE1 PERFORMS BOTH RNASE ACTIVITIES, IRE1 FROM CERTAIN SPECIES OF YEAST EXCLUSIVELY PERFORM ONLY ONE. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO REVEAL THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS OF IRE1 BY CHARACTERIZING IRE1 FROM THE MODEL AMOEBA, DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM, WHICH SHARES A DISTANT COMMON ANCESTOR WITH BOTH YEAST AND MAMMALS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH GENETIC APPROACHES THAT MUTATE AMINO ACID RESIDUES OF AMOEBA IRE1 THAT ARE CONSERVED BETWEEN AMOEBA, YEAST, AND MAMMALS, THEN TESTING WHETHER THESE MUTANTS CAN SURVIVE GROWTH CONDITIONS THAT DISRUPT PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN THE ER. IN ADDITION, IRE1 FROM DIFFERENT SPECIES OF YEAST WILL BE REPLACED WITH IRE1 FROM AMOEBA TO TEST FOR FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY BETWEEN ORGANISMS. IN PARALLEL, CANDIDATE MRNA TARGETS OF AMOEBA IRE1 WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING A BIOINFORMATIC PIPELINE, THEN VALIDATED USING BOTH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO RNASE ASSAYS. LASTLY, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO UNCOVER THE ROLE OF IRE1 AS AN ANCIENT HOST DEFENSE AGAINST INTRACELLULAR PATHOGENS BY EXPLOITING A NATURAL HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTION BETWEEN BACTERIA AND AMOEBA. THE RESULTING DATA WILL ELUCIDATE THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND FUNCTION OF A VITAL CELLULAR SENSOR THAT MAINTAINS CELLULAR HOMEOSTASIS IN ALL EUKARYOTIC CELLS AND DETERMINE HOW IT CAN BE DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATED TO CONTROL CELL FATE.

HOWEVER, ACHIEVING RELIABLE COMBUSTION WITH FUELS THAT EXHIBIT A LARGE SELECTION OF OXYGENATED COMPONENTS, AT HIGHLY FUEL-LEAN CONDITIONS, ACROSS THE OPERATIONAL DOMAIN OF THE ENGINE HAS PROVEN A TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE. LOW-TEMPERATURE PLASMAS (LTP) ARE SEEN AS AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER, DUE TO THEIR DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO ENHANCE COMBUSTION, PROVIDE FAST-GAS HEATING AND FACILITATE FLAME KERNEL GROWTH. BUT THERE REMAINS A KNOWLEDGE GAP ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLASMACHEMICAL EFFECTS AND THE BASIC COMBUSTION PHENOMENON TO EFFECTIVELY COUPLE THE UTILIZATION OF LTP AND BIOFUELS. LEVERAGING UNIQUE EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORMS AND MODELING TOOLS TAILORED FOR PLASMA-ASSISTED COMBUSTION (PAC) RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNCOVER THESE CHEMICAL FUNDAMENTALS THAT COULD DEMONSTRATE ENHANCED CHEMICAL REACTIVITY, IMPROVED ENERGY EXTRACTION AND IGNITION, WITH REDUCED POLLUTANT FORMATION. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE SHARED OPENLY WITH BOTH ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT LTP INNOVATION AND HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON COMBUSTION ENGINEERING FOR VEHICULAR, AEROSPACE AND ENERGY-RELATED APPLICATIONS, WITH OVERARCHING BENEFITS TOWARDS ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES.

THE BROADER IMPACT AND SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF THIS CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR PHASE I PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE AND REDUCE DISASTER-INDUCED FOOD INSECURITY, IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE CONVERGENCE RESEARCH TEAM WILL DEVELOP AN ANNUAL MEASURE OF COMMUNITY FOOD SECURITY AND SUBSCALES FOR INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO COMMUNITY FOOD SECURITY. THIS MEASURE WILL HELP ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY FOLLOWING HURRICANE DISASTERS AND PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION FOR COMMUNITIES TO BUILD FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE TO HAZARDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. BETWEEN 11-15% OF THE U.S. POPULATION EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY ANNUALLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2018. FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY RATES CAN INCREASE THREEFOLD FOLLOWING DISASTERS. HOUSEHOLDS STRUGGLING BEFORE A DISASTER ARE AT GREATEST RISK. INCREASED FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY RATES PERSIST FOR YEARS WHILE HOUSEHOLDS AND COMMUNITIES RECOVER. CURRENTLY, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) MEASURES HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY IN THE US ANNUALLY AND FOOD DESERTS AS A SINGLE DIMENSION OF COMMUNITY LEVEL FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY EVERY FOUR YEARS. FOOD DESERTS ARE AN INDICATOR OF ACCESSIBILITY OF RETAIL FOOD IN COMMUNITIES BUT MISS MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS THAT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY-LEVEL FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A FOOD INDEX FOR RESILIENCE, SECURITY, & TANGIBLE SOLUTIONS (FIRST) THAT MEASURES FOOD SYSTEM FUNCTIONING. THE FIRST WILL COMBINE INFORMATION FROM EXPERTS IN THE FIELDS OF DISASTER SCIENCE, COASTAL ENGINEERING, FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY, NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT, AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE. THE FIRST WILL PROVIDE A TOOL FOR COMMUNITIES PREPARING FOR, RESPONDING TO, AND RECOVERING FROM DISASTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE FOOD SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM MADE UP OF A SET OF AUTONOMOUS, INTERDEPENDENT SUB-SYSTEMS. WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS, MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ARE IMPACTED. CURRENTLY, WE RELY ON SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL AND INFREQUENT MEASURES OF FOOD AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. FURTHER, CURRENT MEASURES DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR DISASTER RISK TO MULTIPLE SUB-SYSTEMS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL GENERATE SPECIFIC AND TIMELY METRICS OF FOOD SYSTEM AND SUB-SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND COMMUNITY FOOD SECURITY TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH ACTIONABLE DATA TO BOLSTER FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE AND REDUCE FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY FOLLOWING HURRICANE DISASTERS. IMPROVED METRICS WILL SUPPORT MITIGATION AND PREPAREDNESS AMID SLOWER ONSET ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE MOST AT-RISK AS WELL AS SUPPORT MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY OF FOOD SYSTEMS AND FOOD SECURITY. USING A CONVERGENCE APPROACH AND SYSTEMS DYNAMICS MODELING METHODOLOGY, OUR TEAM OF ACADEMICS, NON-PROFITS, GOVERNMENT, AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE FIRST. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL AND COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF COMMUNITY-LEVEL FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE (FIRST) THEN RUN THE MODEL TO DESCRIBE FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE FOR PILOT COMMUNITIES IN NORTH CAROLINA. THE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL WILL BE EVALUATED IN THREE HISTORICAL HURRICANE EVENTS IN NORTH CAROLINA TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE METRIC. FIRST SCORES FOR PILOT COUNTIES IN NORTH CAROLINA AS WELL AS HISTORICAL CASE DATA WILL BE SHARED WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GROUND TRUTH THE RESULTS AND ELICIT INFORMATION ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF FIRST SCORES AND HOW THE SCORES COULD BE USED TO BOLSTER FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCE. INFORMATION FROM PILOT COMMUNITIES WILL SET THE STAGE FOR SCALING UP THE MODEL NATIONALLY FOR HURRICANES AND DEVELOPING A ROADMAP WITH TANGIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR BUILDING COMMUNITY FOOD RESILIENCE. ANNUAL MEASUREMENT AT THE COMMUNITY-LEVEL WILL SUPPORT MORE EQUITABLE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, RECOVERY, AND MITIGATION TO REDUCE DISASTER-INDUCED FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY.

THE CONECD CONFERENCE IS DEDICATED TO ALL THE DIVERSE GROUPS THAT COMPRISE OUR ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING WORKFORCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TWOFOLD: 1) TO ENABLE THE HOSTING OF A PANEL OF CAREER AWARDEES AT THE CONECD CONFERENCE AND 2) TO PROVIDE A PRECONFERENCE WORKSHOP TO BRING TOGETHER ENGINEERING DIVERSITY LEADERS (EDLS) FROM ENGINEERING ACADEMIC UNITS FOR A WORKSHOP TO ENHANCE BOTH THEIR DEI (DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION) SKILLSETS AND ENABLE THE CREATION OF A COMMUNITY OF PROFESSIONALS. THE FACULTY EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (CAREER) IS AN NSF-WIDE PROGRAM RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS SUPPORTING EARLY CAREER FACULTY RESEARCH EFFORTS. IT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY ACADEMIC CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LINK BETWEEN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. RESEARCH RESULTS IN THIS AREA MUST BE BROADLY SHARED WITH PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER RESEARCHERS TO REAP THE FULL BENEFITS OF THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES. EDLS ARE TASKED WITH FOSTERING INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND ATTENDING TO RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE, AND/OR FACULTY LEVELS. ADDITIONALLY, THEY SERVE A COMMUNITY THAT INCLUDES PRE-COLLEGE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND STAFF. HOWEVER, BEING BROUGHT IN AS LEADERS AND EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD, MORE IS NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THE DEGREE OF SUPPORT, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND COMMUNITY THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT PERTAIN DIRECTLY TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. BRINGING TOGETHER RESEARCHERS IN THIS SPACE AND PROVIDING PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE THROUGH INFORMATION SHARING IN A WORKSHOP SETTING CAN BE PIVOTAL FOR PRACTITIONERS IN DEI LEADERSHIP. THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE KNOWLEDGE AND COMMUNITY SHARING OF CURRENT PRACTICES IN BROADENING PARTICIPATION THROUGH DEI LEADERSHIP WORK WITH THOSE CHARGED WITH ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS WILL ENABLE THE PRACTITIONERS TO NAVIGATE POLITICAL, RESOURCE-DRIVEN, AND NEW ENVIRONMENTS THAT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF UNDERREPRESENTED AND UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE IN ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING. CREATING A COMMUNITY OF DEI LEADERS IN ENGINEERING/ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY ACADEMIC UNITS WILL FACILITATE SHARING OF IDEAS AND BEST PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS. THE WORK CONDUCTED BY EDLS IS CRITICAL IN ACHIEVING THE STATED GOALS AND VISION OF EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND DIVERSITY AT THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING/TECHNOLOGY LEVEL. THEIR WORK CAN BE FAR-REACHING IN A COLLEGE?S ATTEMPT TO FULFILL ITS STRATEGIC PLANS FOR DEI. FOR MANY COLLEGES, THESE ROLES ARE NEW POSITIONS AND RELATEDLY HAVE A LIMITED BODY OF RESEARCH TO REFERENCE FOR EXPERIENCES, BEST PRACTICES, AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. IT IS VITAL TO CULTIVATE AND ENCOURAGE A COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS BY CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS WITH EACH OTHER TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORY. THIS COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE CAN SHARE NECESSARY TOOLS, RESOURCES, AND SUPPORT TO FURTHER THEIR CAREER GOALS AND WORK SUCCESSES. ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST BRIDGE THE RESEARCH-TO-PRACTICE DIVIDE.

HEAT STRESS CAN RESULT FROM EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FROM HIGH LEVELS OF METABOLIC ACTIVITY OFTEN INVOLVED IN THESE EXPOSED OCCUPATIONS. HEAT STRESS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIR COGNITIVE FUNCTION, DEGRADE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND ENDURANCE, AND ELEVATE THE RISK OF INJURY, ILLNESS AND DEATH. ALTHOUGH HUMAN WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO PLAY MAJOR ROLES IN THESE EXPOSED OCCUPATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES TO MITIGATE THEIR HEAT STRESS HAVE NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION. TO ADDRESS THIS, THE INVESTIGATORS EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL WEARABLE COOLING DEVICES AND WILL OBTAIN PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WILL HELP ASSESS AND IMPROVE THE EFFICACY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND USABILITY OF THE DEVICES. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL ENGAGE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO EXAMINE THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COOLING DEVICES AND THE POTENTIAL NEEDS FOR POLICY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS TO FACILITATE THEIR WIDESPREAD AND EQUITABLE ADOPTION. THE PROPOSED WORK HELPS VALIDATE PAST DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD OF THERMOREGULATORY PHYSIOLOGY: BODY HEAT IS NOT LOST TO THE ENVIRONMENT EQUALLY FROM ALL BODY SURFACES. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN HEAT LOSS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO PREVENT OR TREAT HEAT STRESS IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH FEASIBLE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCESSIBLE.

WHEN STUDENTS HAVE TROUBLE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING REQUIRED STEM COURSES IN THEIR FIRST YEAR, THEY MAY TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES, LEAVE STEM MAJORS, OR EVEN LEAVE COLLEGE ENTIRELY; AND THESE ISSUES ARE MORE COMMON AMONG STUDENTS FROM GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERREPRESENTED AND UNDERSERVED IN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN STEM FIELDS OF STUDY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO HELP STUDENTS IN FIRST YEAR STEM COURSES BY IMPLEMENTING TWO APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE COLLEGE SUCCESS AND PERSISTENCE FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS: THE CO-REQUISITE AND LEARNING ASSISTANT (LA) MODELS. IN THE CO-REQUISITE MODEL, STUDENTS WITH LESS MATH PREPARATION GET TWO ADDITIONAL HOURS OF SUPPORT EACH WEEK, ALLOWING THEM TO GAIN NEEDED SKILLS WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE AN EXTRA SEMESTER OF REMEDIAL MATH. IN THE LA MODEL, FACULTY REDESIGN THEIR COURSES TO INCORPORATE ACTIVE LEARNING, AND ARE SUPPORTED IN THE CLASSROOM BY TRAINED NEAR-PEER STUDENT FACILITATORS (LAS). THIS PROJECT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF COMBINING THE LA AND CO-REQUISITE MODELS IN FIRST-YEAR MATH COURSES AND OF ADDING LAS TO REQUIRED FIRST-YEAR COURSES IN STEM DISCIPLINES NOT YET WELL REPRESENTED IN THE LA LITERATURE. THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO IMPROVE COMPLETION OF STEM COURSES; RETAIN MORE, AND MORE DIVERSE, STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND IN STEM MAJORS; AND REDUCE TIME-TO-GRADUATION. FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE LA AND CO-REQUISITE MODELS WILL CATALYZE IMPROVEMENTS IN STEM TEACHING, CREATE MORE ENGAGING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, AND IMPROVE STUDENTS? QUANTITATIVE SKILLS. FACULTY ENGAGED IN THESE CLASSROOM TRANSFORMATIONS WILL BOTH RECEIVE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO ONE ANOTHER IN A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE.

ONE SUCH NOVELTY, TOXIN TOLERANCE, IS THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIETARY BREADTH OF PLANT-FEEDING INSECTS. IN GENERAL, TOLERANCE OF HIGHLY TOXIC COMPOUNDS IS PREDICTED TO LIMIT THE DIETARY RANGE OF INSECTS. HOWEVER, SOME SPECIES THAT FEED ON A WIDE RANGE OF PLANTS/FUNGI ARE SURPRISINGLY ABLE TO DETOXIFY NOXIOUS CHEMICALS THAT ONLY OCCUR IN A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR HOSTS. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPACT OF SUCH NOVELTIES ON GENERALIST SPECIES IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE TOLERANCE TO POTENT MUSHROOM TOXINS IN A FLY SPECIES THAT USES A DIVERSE SET OF FRUIT AND MUSHROOMS AS HOSTS. BY INVESTIGATING HOW NOVELTY AFFECTS GENERALIST SPECIES AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT IS MAINTAINED, THESE STUDIES WILL INFORM PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF NOVEL ADAPTATIONS. FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RESEARCH ARE ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO INCREASE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL FACILITATE INCREASED INCLUSION OF STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED GROUPS. IN ADDITION, THE WORK WILL IMPLEMENT IN-CLASS, HANDS-ON RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES, AND GENERATE A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASE CONTAINING TRAIT INFORMATION FOR THE FLY SPECIES. FLIES IN THE GENUS DROSOPHILA EXHIBIT A SPECTRUM OF FEEDING BEHAVIORS. THESE RANGE FROM SPECIALISTS ON A SINGLE TOXIC FRUIT TO GENERALISTS THAT FEED ON A VARIETY OF MUSHROOMS. MUSHROOM-FEEDERS CAN TOLERATE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DEADLY MUSHROOM TOXINS THAT ARE LETHAL TO MANY ORGANISMS. ONE MUSHROOM FEEDER, DROSOPHILA TRIPUNCTATA, IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT USES A COMBINATION OF FRUIT AND MUSHROOM HOSTS. IN POPULATIONS OF THIS SPECIES, THE DEGREE OF TOXIN TOLERANCE VARIES. IN ADDITION, FEMALES EXHIBIT EGG-LAYING PREFERENCE FOR EITHER FRUIT OR MUSHROOMS. USING A LOCAL POPULATION OF DROSOPHILA TRIPUNCTATA, THE PLANNED RESEARCH WILL TEST THREE HYPOTHESES. THE FIRST IS THAT TOXIN TOLERANCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE SYMPATRIC SPECIATION. THE SECOND IS THAT MAINTAINING THIS NOVEL ADAPTATION INCREASES GENETIC DIVERSITY. FINALLY, THE THIRD IS THAT THE BENEFITS OF MAINTAINING TOXIN TOLERANCE OUTWEIGH THE ASSOCIATED COSTS. THE COMPLEMENTARY EVOLUTIONARY, BEHAVIORAL, AND ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS OF A NOVEL ADAPTATION IN A GENERALIST SPECIES WILL BEGIN TO UNCOVER THE IMPACTS OF THESE TYPES OF TRAITS AND CHARACTERIZE THE SELECTIVE PRESSURES THAT MAINTAIN THEM.

BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS TO DECIDE WHETHER AND HOW TO ACT. ADAPTIVE SOCIAL LEARNING, HOWEVER, ONLY WORKS WHEN PEOPLE ACCURATELY SENSE OTHERS? THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, MOUNTING EVIDENCE SHOWS LARGE, SYSTEMATIC AND PERSISTENT ERRORS IN PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE BELIEFS AND ACTIONS OF OTHERS. IN PARTICULAR, PEOPLE MOST DRAMATICALLY UNDERESTIMATE OTHERS? CLIMATE CONCERNS AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT. THESE UNDERESTIMATES CAN STIFLE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE, POLICY SUPPORT, AND COLLECTIVE ACTION BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND DISCOURAGE RESPONSES FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS, WHO RESPOND TO WHAT THEY SEE AS THEIR CONSTITUENTS? PRIORITIES. THIS RESEARCH DEVELOPS A FRAMEWORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE HAVE MISPRECEPTIONS AND WHAT METHODS CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF PERCEPTIONS. CLOSING THIS GAP CAN ENCOURAGE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. FURTHERMORE, UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF PERSISTENT SOCIAL MISPERCEPTIONS IS RELEVANT FOR A BROAD RANGE OF PROBLEMS. BY STUDYING A FUNDAMENTAL COGNITIVE CHALLENGE FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION, THIS RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO SCHOLARSHIP ON OPINION FORMATION AND SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HUMANKIND?S SOCIAL NATURE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MOBILIZE CLIMATE ACTION. ADDRESSING COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS TO ENGAGE IN A HOST OF COORDINATED BEHAVIORS TO EFFECT WIDESPREAD SYSTEMIC CHANGES. RECENT WORK SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT OTHERS SHARE THEIR CONCERNS AND DESIRE FOR ACTION. YET, WHILE MOST PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERESTIMATE OTHERS? CONCERN, WHICH CAN INHIBIT ACTION TOWARD ADDRESSING COLLECTIVE CHALLENGES. DRAWING ON INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT USES CROSS-SECTIONAL, LONGITUDINAL, AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS ACROSS MULTIPLE SAMPLES TO DEVELOP AND TEST AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK ILLUMINATING DRIVERS OF PERVASIVE SOCIAL MISPERCEPTIONS AND PATHWAYS FOR CORRECTING THESE BIASES.

BY FOCUSING ON COLLABORATIVE HUMAN-AI FACIAL TRACKING AND ANALYSIS, THIS TECHNOLOGY ADDRESSES ETHICAL CONCERNS AND MITIGATES THE RISKS AND CONSEQUENCES OF TRADITIONAL FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROJECT PROMOTES DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN STEM FIELDS BY EMPHASIZING A DIVERSE TEAM TO COMBAT BIAS AND EQUITY ISSUES IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. THE TECHNOLOGY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL DEFENSE EFFORTS BY ENABLING EFFICIENT SEARCH FOR FACIAL ATTRIBUTES OF INTEREST BASED ON SEMANTIC QUERIES. THIS ASPECT IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN PUBLIC SAFETY SCENARIOS WITH LARGE CROWDS AND HIGH-SECURITY CONCERNS. BY REDUCING BIAS, IMPROVING ACCURACY, AND ADDRESSING PRIVACY AND ETHICAL CONCERNS, THE TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE AI INDUSTRY WHILE ADVANCING THE WELFARE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND SUPPORTING SECURITY EFFORTS. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE FACE ANALYZER/SEMANTIC SEARCH, AN AI SYSTEM BRIDGING DESCRIPTIVE TEXT AND FACIAL PHOTOS. UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS, WHICH NECESSITATE A PROBE PHOTO FOR COMPARISONS, THE COMPANY'S INNOVATION SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THIS REQUIREMENT. THIS APPROACH OFFERS BENEFITS IN TERMS OF TIME, COST, AND ACCURACY, CHALLENGING THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IN THE FIELD. THE PROJECT'S INITIAL CHALLENGE INVOLVES ASSEMBLING DIVERSE TRAINING DATASETS WITH LABELED FACE PHOTOS AND TEXTUAL DESCRIPTIONS, ESTABLISHING A SCALABLE DATA PIPELINE TO ENHANCE ACCURACY AND MITIGATE BIAS.

SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 450,000 DEATHS ANNUALLY AND IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES. OF THESE DEATHS, ~350,000 OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL. SURVIVAL FOR OHCA IN THE U.S. IS AROUND 8%-10%, AND DESPITE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT THIS STATISTIC HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. THE SOLUTION TO IMPROVING OHCA OUTCOMES IS EARLY AND EFFECTIVE BYSTANDER CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (E.G., CHEST COMPRESSIONS) AND PROMPT DEFIBRILLATION USING AN AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED). IN LOCATIONS WITH PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE AEDS, SURVIVAL HAS INCREASED 40%-70%. HOWEVER, ~70% OF OHCAS EVENTS OCCUR IN PRIVATE RESIDENCE, AND PUBLIC-ACCESS AEDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THESE PATIENTS. DRONES CAN DELIVER AEDS TO THE SCENE OF A CARDIAC ARREST MORE QUICKLY THAN A GROUND AMBULANCE TEAM, ENABLING EARLY DEFIBRILLATION BY BYSTANDERS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SURVIVAL RATES. THE IMPACT ON EMS RESPONSE TIMES WILL LIKELY BE GREATEST FOR PATIENTS CURRENTLY NOT WELL SERVED BY EMS SYSTEMS SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN POOR AND MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS. EMS DRONES CAN ALSO ADDRESS OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS DELIVERING NALOXONE FOR OPIOID OVERDOSES AND BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR THE PRE-CLINICAL TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK. THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT ADDRESSES CRITICAL BARRIERS TO CREATING A 911-INTEGRATED DRONE SERVICE. FIRST, IT DEVELOPS ALGORITHMS TO OPTIMIZE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF DRONES GIVEN PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS. SECOND, IT INTEGRATES THE EMERGENCY CARE DRONE RESPONSE DIRECTLY INTO THE 911 DISPATCH PROCESS. THE SYSTEM USES STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTION AND DATA INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME LAUNCH DECISION SUPPORT AND ASSET TRACKING CAPABILITIES TO THE 911 DISPATCHER. THE RESULT IS A DRONE RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT IS ACCURATE, FAST, AND SCALABLE. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON DELIVERING AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS TO VICTIMS OF OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARRESTS. THE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM AND UNDERLYING ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED IN THIS WORK CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER USE CASES INTEGRATING DRONE SERVICES INTO THE 911 RESPONSE.

INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES (TAKEN BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS) OFTEN FALL SHORT OF THEIR POTENTIAL DUE TO OUTDATED TEACHING METHODS, CLASSROOM PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT INCLUSIVE, AND A PAUCITY OF DIVERSE ROLE MODELS. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STEM FIELDS THAT HAVE MADE STRIDES IN DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING INNOVATIVE TEACHING APPROACHES THAT WELCOME DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES, ECONOMICS HAS LAGGED BEHIND. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ABILITY OF ECONOMICS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IS COMPROMISED. THE LACK OF DIVERSITY NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE TOPICS STUDIED BUT ALSO LIMITS THE EXCHANGE OF DIVERSE IDEAS IN THE CLASSROOM, HINDERING BROADER SOCIETAL PROGRESS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING A CLASSROOM INTERVENTION USING EVIDENCE-BASED METHODS FROM STEM EDUCATION LITERATURE, WITH THE GOAL OF BROADENING PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMICS, ENHANCING STUDENT SENSE OF BELONGING, AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AND RETENTION IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF MODULES INSTRUCTORS CAN EASILY PLUG INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES DESIGNED TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO DIVERSE ROLE MODELS AND A RANGE OF EXCITING AND RELEVANT TOPICS THROUGH PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED VIDEOS. ACCOMPANYING CURRICULAR MATERIALS, GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED ACTIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLES, WILL DEEPEN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING. THE PROJECT HYPOTHESIZES THAT THIS INTERVENTION WILL POSITIVELY INFLUENCE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ECONOMICS, STRENGTHEN THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING IN ECONOMICS AND THEIR BELIEF IN THEIR OWN ABILITIES, AND IMPROVE LEARNING, PERSISTENCE, AND RETENTION, PARTICULARLY AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS. THE MODULES WILL ALSO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMICS INSTRUCTORS, ENABLING THEM TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER THESE EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES AND DELIVERING THEM TO THE INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS CLASSROOM, THIS TIER 1 PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE IUSE: EDU PROGRAM'S ENGAGED STUDENT LEARNING TRACK, AIMING TO IMPROVE ECONOMICS EDUCATION, ENGAGE STUDENTS THROUGH INNOVATIVE AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES, ENHANCE DIVERSITY, AND PREPARE STUDENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO FURTHERS THE NSF MISSION BY EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE ON STEM EDUCATION AND INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE US TO CONDUCT RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS, A CRUCIAL STEM FIELD, BY CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE VIBRANT AND DIVERSE ECONOMICS WORKFORCE. THIS PROJECT USES A MIXED METHODS RESEARCH APPROACH BY INCORPORATING FOCUS GROUP INPUT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT MODULES AND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR IMPACT EVALUATION. THE PROJECT TEAM PLANS TO DEPLOY THE MODULES IN CLASSES AT VARIED TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH INSTRUCTORS. EACH INSTRUCTOR WILL HAVE A ?CONTROL? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY DO NOT USE THE MODULES AND A ?TREATMENT? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT THE PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS THAT WILL BE USED TO COLLECT DATA ON CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS STEM IDENTITY, SELF-EFFICACY, CONNECTEDNESS AND BELONGING, AND PERCEPTIONS OF PERSISTENCE IN ECONOMICS. COMBINING THAT DATA WITH INSTITUTIONAL DATA, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL PERFORM DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES REGRESSIONS TO ANALYZE PROJECT IMPACTS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT LIES IN LEVERAGING THE EXISTING EVIDENCE ABOUT ACTIVE LEARNING AND ROLE MODELS TO CREATE A NOVEL SET OF MODULES, COMBINING DIVERSE ROLE MODELS, POLICY RELEVANCE, AND ACTIVE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO SHAPE DIVERSE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS, IDENTITY, AND PERSISTENCE. THE MODULES ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADAPTABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS, FACILITATING THEIR EASY INTEGRATION INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS CLASSROOMS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBER OF BLACK, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FACULTY HAS REMAINED LOW FOR THE LAST DECADE DESPITE TARGETED RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE TOXIC AND OPPRESSIVE CULTURE OF EXCLUSION, DEVALUING, AND BIAS DISCOURAGES MANY FROM PURSUING AN ACADEMIC CAREER AND PREVENTS TALENTED, BLACK FACULTY FROM SUCCEEDING. TO REDUCE THIS RACIALLY CENTERED LOSS FROM ENGINEERING, THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO USE A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY BASED METHODS SUCH AS SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS TO INVESTIGATE ACTIVITIES THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING PROGRAMS CAN ADOPT TO SUPPORT BLACK JUNIOR FACULTY IN THEIR CAREER PROGRESSION. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE, EASY-TO-USE GUIDANCE MANUAL TO EVALUATE THE PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS OF JUNIOR FACULTY IN THREE AREAS: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PROMOTION & TENURE AND JOB SATISFACTION & SUPPORT. THE BENEFIT OF THIS WORK TO SOCIETY RESULTS FROM PROVIDING A TOOL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF RACIALLY DIVERSE FACULTY. IN TURN, THIS RESULTS IN THE PROMOTION OF CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING, ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND COMPETENCY IN THE ENGINEERING WORKFORCE.

THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR FRACTURE FIXATION DEVICES (E.G., MEDICAL IMPLANTS) IS EXPECTED TO REACH $13.6 BILLION BY 2027, GROWING AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 6.1% OVER THAT TIME. THIS FACULTY EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT (CAREER) AWARD ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT HEALTHCARE CHALLENGE BY ENHANCING THE CLINICAL FEASIBILITY OF BIODEGRADABLE MAGNESIUM-BASED METALLIC IMPLANTS. THE UTILIZATION OF BIODEGRADABLE IMPLANTS IN BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING VASCULAR STENTS AND SMALL BONE FIXATION DEVICES, PRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED PERMANENT METALLIC IMPLANTS. THESE PERMANENT METALLIC IMPLANTS OFTEN ENTAIL SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS AND MAY NECESSITATE SURGICAL INTERVENTION. ALTHOUGH BIODEGRADABLE MAGNESIUM-BASED IMPLANTS HOLD PROMISE, THEIR RAPID DEGRADATION UNDERMINES THEIR EFFICACY BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE HEALING PROCESS. THIS PROJECT INTRODUCES INNOVATIVE HYBRID COATINGS, COMBINING DIFFERENT COATING METHODS AND MATERIALS, TO MITIGATE DEGRADATION AND ALLOW THE CONTROLLED RELEASE OF BIOACTIVE AGENTS. BY INVESTIGATING HOW BIOACTIVE AGENTS INTERACT WITH COATED MAGNESIUM, THE PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND DEGRADATION INHIBITION MECHANISMS AND MODULATE DEGRADATION RATES. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PREDICT DEGRADATION AND AGENT RELEASE, BRIDGING THEORY AND EXPERIMENT. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RESEARCH LIES IN ITS POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE PATIENT-SPECIFIC BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS BY TAILORING THE DEGRADATION RATES AND HENCE THE LIFESPAN OF AN IMPLANT. SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES MAY LEAD TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF A VARIETY OF IMPLANTS INCLUDING ORTHOPEDIC, FACIAL, ORAL, AND MORE, BENEFITING PATIENTS WITH PERSONALIZED NEEDS. THIS PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE NSF'S MISSION BY ADVANCING SCIENCE, PROMOTING HEALTH, AND CONTRIBUTING TO NATIONAL WELFARE. RECOGNIZING THE UNDERREPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN GROUPS, THE PROJECT INCLUDES A COMMUNITY-BASED MENTORING PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO EXPOSE UNDERSERVED HISPANIC CHILDREN IN CHATTANOOGA AND THE SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AREA TO STEM THROUGH HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES, FOSTERING ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC INVOLVEMENT. THE PI ALSO PLANS TO WORK WITH THE SOCIETY OF WOMEN ENGINEERS AT THE UNIVERSITY TO INTRODUCE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH, ENCOURAGING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN STEM FIELDS. MOREOVER, A GRADUATE COURSE ON MANUFACTURING OF BIOMATERIALS WILL BE DEVELOPED, ENRICHING EDUCATION AND NURTURING FUTURE PROFESSIONALS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THIS RESEARCH PROJECT ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGE OF RAPID DEGRADATION IN MAGNESIUM-BASED BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS, HINDERING THEIR CLINICAL IMPACT. BY EMPLOYING HYBRID COATING SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY PLASMA ELECTROLYTIC OXIDATION (PEO) COUPLED WITH THE SOL-GEL COATING METHOD, THE PROJECT AIMS TO CONTROL DEGRADATION RATES AND ENHANCE BIOACTIVE AGENT RELEASE FOR SMART BIOMATERIALS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ADDRESS GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS BEHIND ENHANCED CORROSION RESISTANCE OF COATED MAGNESIUM IMPLANTS AND THE EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF BIOACTIVE AGENT RELEASE DURING PROLONGED IMPLANTATION PERIODS. TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES GUIDE THE INVESTIGATION: OBJECTIVE #1 FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTION OF BIOACTIVE AGENTS WITH THE POROUS SURFACE OF PEO-COATED MAGNESIUM SUBSTRATES, ELUCIDATING THEIR ROLE AS CORROSION INHIBITORS THROUGH MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION AND ELECTROCHEMICAL CORROSION MECHANISMS. OBJECTIVE #2 INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VERSATILE NUMERICAL MODEL BASED ON A PHYSICAL MODELING APPROACH TO PREDICT DEGRADATION RATES AND BIOACTIVE AGENT RELEASE FROM MAGNESIUM SUBSTRATES COATED WITH HYBRID PEO-BASED AND MULTIPLE LAYERS OF HYDROXYAPATITE (HA) SOL-GEL COATINGS. ONE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF DEPOSITING THIN (< 100 NM) SUBSEQUENT COATING LAYERS. THAT ENABLES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPOSITED COATING LAYERS AND DEGRADATION RATES. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRUCIAL FOR ENSURING A TIME-CERTAIN COMMENCEMENT OF THE IMPLANT?S DEGRADATION, A VITAL ASPECT FOR PATIENT-SPECIFIC IMPLANT APPLICATIONS. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH COMBINES EXPERTISE IN BIOMATERIALS PROCESSING, CORROSION SCIENCE, AND NUMERICAL MODELING. THE ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES HOLD THE POTENTIAL TO INTEGRATE MAGNESIUM AS A BIODEGRADABLE METAL TECHNOLOGY IN CLINICAL SETTINGS, PARTICULARLY FOR PATIENT-SPECIFIC DEVICES IN ORTHOPEDIC AND CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL APPLICATIONS. THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO (1) DEVELOP A NEW COMMUNITY-BASED MENTORING PROGRAM FOR HISPANIC CHILDREN AGES 11 TO 18, (2) ORGANIZE TALKS, PRESENTATIONS, AND LIVE DEMONSTRATIONS AIMING AT RECRUITING MORE FEMALE RESEARCH STUDENTS, AND (3) DEVELOP A GRADUATE INTERDISCIPLINARY COURSE ON THE TOPIC OF ?MANUFACTURING OF BIOMATERIALS?. THESE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES WILL OFFER STEM EXPOSURE, SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT, CAREER DEVELOPMENT, AND ADVISING, PARTICULARLY FOR HISPANIC AND FEMALE STUDENTS IN CHATTANOOGA AND THE SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AREA.

DEEP IN THE EARTH, CLAY, SANDSTONE, AND LIMESTONE ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CRYSTALLINE METAMORPHIC ROCKS LIKE SCHISTS, QUARTZITES, AND MARBLES. CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT TRANSFORM SEDIMENTARY MINERALS INTO METAMORPHIC MINERALS CAN ALSO RELEASE FLUIDS SUCH AS WATER (H2O) AND CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), ORIGINALLY TRAPPED IN THE SEDIMENTARY MINERALS. THESE FLUIDS HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON EARTH PROCESSES SUCH AS THE FORMATION OF VOLCANOES, THE TRIGGERING OF EARTHQUAKES, AND THE FORMATION OF VALUABLE ORE DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, THESE FLUIDS MAY MAKE IT TO THE EARTH?S SURFACE WHERE THEY AFFECT THE CLIMATE. OVER THE LAST 50-60 YEARS MOST SCIENTISTS WORKED WITHIN THE PARADIGM THAT METAMORPHISM IS A SLOW PROCESS, RELEASING FLUIDS GRADUALLY OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS DURING MOUNTAIN-BUILDING EVENTS. HOWEVER, MORE RECENT WORK SUGGESTS THAT METAMORPHIC PROCESSES MAY OCCUR RELATIVELY RAPIDLY IN BRIEF BURSTS THAT MAY OCCUR OVER TIMESCALES OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OR LESS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE MORE RECENT ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT RAPID METAMORPHISM. THIS STUDY MAY SHIFT LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATIONS THAT METAMORPHISM OCCURS OVER VERY LONG TIMESCALES TO A NEW PARADIGM OF MORE RAPID RECRYSTALLIZATION, METAMORPHIC MINERAL GROWTH AND RELEASE OF FLUIDS AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER VIEWS ON EARTH PROCESSES.

THE FIELD, LABORATORY AND GEOCHRONOLOGICAL STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON A COMPARISON OF ROCKS FROM THE SAME OUTCROP THAT DISPLAY NUMEROUS SMALL GARNETS AND FEW LARGE GARNETS. NUCLEATION THEORY PREDICTS THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW CRYSTALS (I.E. NUCLEI) THAT FORM UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS IS A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF OVERSTEPPING OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REACTION (CALLED THE ?AFFINITY?). THE PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF GARNET FORMATION WILL BE DETERMINED FROM A COMBINATION OF INCLUSION BAROMETRY USING RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AND TRACE ELEMENT THERMOMETRY (E.G., QUARTZ OR GRAPHITE-IN-GARNET; ZR IN RUTILE THERMOMETRY) TO SEE IF GARNETS NUCLEATED AT CONSISTENT DISPLACEMENTS FROM THE EQUILIBRIUM ISOGRAD FOR THE BULK COMPOSITION OR WHETHER THEY NUCLEATED AT SIMILAR P?T CONDITIONS, WHICH WOULD SUGGEST SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT DEGREES OF OVERSTEPPING AT A COMMON POINT OF GARNET NUCLEATION. AGES OF GARNET FORMATION USING SM-ND GEOCHRONOLOGY WILL CONSTRAIN WHETHER GARNETS FROM BOTH TYPES OF SAMPLES NUCLEATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES CONSISTENT WITH THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OF THE EQUILIBRIUM ISOGRAD, OR AS PART OF A SINGLE OROGENIC-SCALE NUCLEATION EVENT.

THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THE TRADITIONALLY EXCLUDED, HAVE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT RESULT IN HIGH LEVELS OF DISTRESS THAT IS NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE BUT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS WITHIN THEIR COLLEGIATE EXPERIENCES. THE PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THREE INTERESTS OF THE BPE PROGRAM: 1) UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT PREVENT TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FROM PURSUING AND SUCCEEDING IN ENGINEERING, 2) DEVELOP INNOVATIVE METHODS AND PROJECTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND EMPLOYEES FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES, AND 3) DESIGN AND TRANSFORM CULTURE TO MAKE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION A PRIORITY IN THE ENGINEERING ENTERPRISE. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ENGINEERING EDUCATION, WHEN PERFORMED TRADITIONALLY, CAN SERVE AS A STRESSOR THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO (1) CAUSE/INITIATE SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL LEVELS OF DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION OR (2) MAINTAIN OR EXACERBATE PRE-EXISTING STRESS REACTIONS. THE PROJECT GUIDING RESEARCH QUESTIONS INCLUDE: WHAT ARE THE BASELINE LEVELS OF STRESS AND DISTRESS FOR BLACK, LATIN, AND INDIGENOUS (BLI) ENGINEERING STUDENTS, BASED ON THEIR SELF-IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL LIFE EVENTS AND HOW DO THE RACIALIZED EXPERIENCES OF BLI STUDENTS UNIQUELY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS WE WILL USE VALIDATED TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY TO ASSESS THE BASELINE STRESS, DISTRESS, AND TRAUMAS OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS AND FOLLOW-UP WITH IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH UNDERGRADUATE BLI STUDENTS TO THEMATICALLY ANALYZE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESSING AND TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THE PROJECT INCLUDES 1) DEFINING RACIALIZED STRESS, DISTRESS, AND TRAUMA IN ENGINEERING, WHICH WILL EXPAND THE ENGINEERING AND STEM COMMUNITIES' KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS DEFAULT EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES INCREASE EACH OF THESE IN STUDENTS; 2) ARTICULATING THE INTERSECTIONAL EXPERIENCES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH THAT OCCUR WITHIN ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 3) EXPAND THE USE OF EXISTING THEORIES AND PRACTICE FOR UNDERSTANDING RACIALIZED STRESS, DISTRESS, AND TRAUMA, TO FOSTER POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR BLI ENGINEERING STUDENTS. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT INCLUDES 1) PRODUCE A MODEL OF BLI ENGINEERING STUDENTS' CHARACTERIZATION OF TRAUMA RELATED TO THEIR ENGINEERING EDUCATION TO DEFINE AND DEVELOP MEASURES OF STRESS AND TRAUMA IN ENGINEERING, 2) IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT LEAD TO TRAUMATIC RESPONSES FOR BLI STUDENTS, AND 3) DEVELOP AND UPDATE ENGINEERING EDUCATION PEDAGOGY BY HELPING ENGINEERING FACULTY RECOGNIZE HOW THEIR BEHAVIORS OR INTERACTIONS WITH STUDENTS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO STUDENTS' REPEATED OVER-EXPOSURE TO STRESS THAT COULD LEAD TO TRAUMATIC RESPONSES.

WHILE THE NUMBER OF HISPANIC STUDENTS, WHO ARE U.S. CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS, EARNING STEM BACHELOR'S DEGREES HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY DURING THE PAST DECADE, HISPANIC STUDENTS ENROLLED IN STEM PROGRAMS ARE LEAVING COLLEGE OR SWITCHING MAJORS AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS. THIS LOSS MAY BE RELATED TO THE STEREOTYPES, LACK OF SUPPORT, AND THE EXCLUSIONARY SPACES THAT HISPANIC STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO IN COLLEGE. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A STRONG STEM IDENTITY IS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF PERSISTENCE AND SUCCESS IN STEM DISCIPLINES. UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF HISPANIC STUDENTS' IDENTITY, AND THE BALANCE OF THAT IDENTITY, IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL STEREOTYPES, COULD LEAD TO IMPROVED STEM UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC, RESEARCH AND INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS, WHICH WOULD ADVANCE PERSISTENCE TO BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION. THE PROJECT TEAM IS EXPLORING A FRAMEWORK THAT CONSIDERS BOTH IMPLICITLY AND EXPLICITLY HELD IDENTITIES FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW STUDENTS ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN A STRONG STEM IDENTITY ACROSS TIME, AND WHAT EXPERIENCES FACILITATE OR HINDER THIS PROCESS. THE RESEARCHERS HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE STRENGTH AND NATURE OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN IMPLICITLY HELD ASSOCIATIONS AND IDENTITIES INFLUENCE STUDENT'S EXPLICITLY HELD STEM IDENTITY, AND THAT THESE PROCESSES ARE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT DUE TO PREVAILING STEREOTYPES FOR WHITE AND HISPANIC UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, ENROLLED IN ENGINEERING AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES DEGREE PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION IS ALSO EXAMINING THE IDENTITY TRAJECTORIES OF WHITE AND HISPANIC UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AS THEY MAKE CRITICAL CAREER AND ACADEMIC DECISIONS.

THIS HAS LED TO A NEW WAVE OF GROWTH IN THE POPULARITY OF VIDEO-BASED TEAMS, AND IT HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP PRODUCTIVE, SUCCESSFUL, AND HEALTHY HUMAN INTERACTIONS USING SMART DEVICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE MIGRATION TO DIGITAL PLATFORMS THAT IS FURTHER SPURRED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED BARRIERS TO INTERACTIONS, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION. DUE TO THE STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT VIDEOCONFERENCING (AND THUS VIRTUAL MEETINGS) WILL CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE PANDEMIC ENDS, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP MORE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE ENVIRONMENTS THAT SUPPORT PRODUCTIVITY AND COLLABORATIVE CREATIVITY IN DIVERSE VIRTUAL TEAM CONTEXTS. THE PROJECT WILL DESIGN A NOVEL SMART MEETING ASSISTANT (SMA) AS A TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTION TO EFFICIENTLY ENHANCE VIDEO-BASED TEAM INNOVATION. THE HIGH-LEVEL GOAL OF SMA WILL BE TO FACILITATE OBJECTIVES SUCH AS: (I) COLLABORATIVE CREATIVITY; (II) CONVERGENT THINKING BY CLUSTERING OF IDEAS FROM SIMILAR TOPICS; (III) FEASIBILITY OF GENERATED IDEAS THROUGH VIDEO-BASED MEETINGS; (IV) REDUCING BIAS IN VIDEO-BASED TEAMS.

THE TOTAL COST OF ILLNESSES DUE TO SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION IN THE U.S. ALONE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN $10.69 BILLION IN 2018. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE TRANSFORMATIVE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR DETECTING SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION ALONG THE POULTRY SUPPLY CHAIN, LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY, SECURITY, EQUITY, EFFICIENCY, AND RESILIENCE. BY DEVELOPING MULTI-SECTORAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE POULTRY INDUSTRY, RETAIL MARKETS, FOOD BANKS, AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP OF RESEARCHERS ACROSS FIVE INSTITUTIONS TO INVESTIGATE AND IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED SENSOR-ENABLED FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND SALMONELLA MITIGATION TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM-WIDE EQUITABLE FOOD SAFETY AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ADAPTED FOR THE DETECTION OF OTHER FOODBORNE PATHOGENS IN BEEF, PORK, DAIRY, AND GREEN LEAF PRODUCTS. IT MAY ALSO BE APPLIED TO DIAGNOSE BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CLINICAL SETTINGS. THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY WILL ENSURE EQUITABLE FOOD SECURITY FOR LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONSUMERS AND REDUCE THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF FOODBORNE DISEASES, ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERPRIVILEGED POPULATIONS WHO ARE FACING HIGHER FOOD SECURITY RISKS. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL WORK ALONGSIDE MULTISECTORAL PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS IN FOOD NUTRITION, ACCESSIBILITY, AND EQUITY. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE RESEARCH AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE CONVERGENCE SCIENCE APPROACHES AT THE INTERSECTION OF FOOD SCIENCE, PUBLIC HEALTH, ANIMAL SCIENCES, DATA SCIENCE, AND SENSING TECHNOLOGY.

THE PROPOSED SENSING TECHNOLOGIES ARE UNIQUE IN TERMS OF MULTIPLEX/SIMULTANEOUS, QUANTITATIVE, AND SELECTIVE DETECTION, AND SURVEILLANCE OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN 30 MINUTES ASSAY TIME. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DEVELOPING A SURFACE ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS) SENSOR ON A SIDE POLISHED MULTIMODE OPTICAL FIBER CORE, WHICH IS INTEGRATED INTO A 3-DIMENSIONAL PRINTED MICROSTRUCTURE AT A 15-DEGREE ANGLE TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERACTION OF THE EXCITATION LASER WITH THE ANALYTES, WHILE THE NANOANTENNA ARRAYS WILL BE CREATED USING LOW-COST MICROSPHERE PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY. SALMONELLA ANTIGENS WILL BE DETECTED AND QUANTIFIED BY MEASURING THEIR VIBRATIONAL FINGERPRINT SERS SPECTRA. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE INNOVATIVE FEATURES OF AN IMPEDANCE-BASED BIOSENSOR ON THE SAME CHIP TO CONCENTRATE THE VIRAL ANTIGEN SAMPLE TO A DETECTABLE THRESHOLD, CAPTURE, AND DETECT THE PATHOGENS USING ARRAYS OF ELECTRODES COATED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES TO ENABLE SIMULTANEOUS AND SELECTIVE DETECTION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS. INSTEAD OF TIMELY AND COSTLY WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING, THE NANOPORE-FACILITATED, MULTI-LOCUS CHECKPOINT SEQUENCING SENSOR DIFFERENTIATES SALMONELLA SEROVARS BY RAPID SCREENING A PANEL OF SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE-VARIATION SEROTYPING MARKERS DISTRIBUTED IN ONE OR MULTI-LOCUS.

THROUGH CREATING A DISTRIBUTED CENTER ACROSS SELECTED PARTNER INSTITUTIONS, WE ARE SEEKING TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN A SHIFT WITHIN ECD TOWARDS THE PRINCIPLES OF INCLUSIVE PEDAGOGY. SUCH A SHIFT WILL ELIMINATE THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL ECD, WHICH CAN OFTEN EXCLUDE GROUPS OF PEOPLES, REINFORCE STEREOTYPES, AND LEAVE PARTNER COMMUNITIES WANTING MORE. REPLACEMENT WITH AN INCLUSIVE ECD CAN SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR, THEIR ASSETS, AND THEIR NEEDS WHILE POSITIVELY IMPACTING PARTNER COMMUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN EFFORTS OF BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN ENGINEERING.

THIS UNDERLYING GLOBAL LEARNER MINDSET IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN CULTIVATING A GLOBAL ENGINEERING COMPETENCY. MOST INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCE RESEARCH AND ASSOCIATED GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING THE GLOBAL ENGINEERING SKILLSET OF STUDENTS THROUGH LONG-TERM TRAVEL EXPERIENCES SUCH AS STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE EXPENSIVE, REQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND MONEY, LIMITING THE PARTICIPATION TO MORE PRIVILEGED MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY, AND ARE NOT SCALABLE TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION FROM LARGE NUMBERS OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL FILL A GAP IN THE RESEARCH BY FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDENTS? GLOBAL LEARNER MINDSET WITHOUT REQUIRING EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW FOUR DIFFERENT GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS (THE USE OF ENGINEERING CASE STUDIES, THE INTENTIONAL FORMATION OF MULTI-NATIONAL STUDENT TEAMS, A COLLABORATIVE ONLINE INTERNATIONAL LEARNING (COIL) RESEARCH PROJECT, AND A COMMUNITY ENGAGED PROJECT WITHIN A SHORT COURSE) CAN DEVELOP A GLOBAL LEARNER MINDSET.

THE PROJECT EXAMINES TWO BROAD RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE COMBINATION OF FOOD SECURITY, FOOD ACCESS, AND FOOD BUSINESS OWNERSHIP THAT CONSTITUTE A COMMUNITY?S FOOD ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRST QUESTION IS: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF STATE AND LOCAL POLICY IN THE FOOD ENVIRONMENT IN THE UNITED STATES? FURTHER, HOW DO STATE AND LOCAL FOOD POLICIES AFFECT INDIVIDUAL FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD ACCESS? THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE STUDY ARE NUMEROUS.

EVOLUTION IS AN INHERENTLY ALGORITHMIC PROCESS: COMPLEX ADAPTATIONS IN LIVING ORGANISMS EMERGE FROM THE BASIC FORCES OF REPLICATION, VARIATION AND SELECTION ACTING TOGETHER ON AN EVOLVING SEQUENCE OF GENETIC MATERIAL. IN THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN LEVERAGED AT A HIGH LEVEL TO DEVELOP EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS: COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO ADAPT SOLUTIONS TO COMPUTATIONALLY HARD PROBLEMS. DESPITE THEIR POPULARITY ON A WIDE RANGE OF PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THEIR WORKING PRINCIPLES, OR HOW THE STRUCTURE OF PROBLEMS MIGHT INFLUENCE THEIR APPLICABILITY. MOREOVER, THERE IS A RICH POTENTIAL OF UNTAPPED INTERDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE SITUATED AT THE CONFLUENCE OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND ALGORITHMS. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS BY ESTABLISHING AN ALGORITHMIC EVOLUTION LAB TO SERVE AS AN INCUBATOR OF SCIENTIFIC IDEAS THAT EXPLORE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ALGORITHMIC EVOLUTION AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF EVOLVING POPULATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THE ALGORITHMIC EVOLUTION LAB IS TO STUDY EVOLUTION AND ADAPTATION FROM THE LENS OF COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE DEVELOPING NEW INSIGHTS INTO HOW DIFFERENT FORCES AFFECT THE SPEED OF ADAPTATION IN BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SETTINGS. IT WILL ALSO YIELD RIGOROUS PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES FOR OPTIMIZATION HEURISTICS COMING FROM THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AS SOCIETY BECOMES MORE RELIANT ON TECHNIQUES FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, IT IS INCREASINGLY MORE CRITICAL THAT THESE ALGORITHMS ARE RIGOROUSLY ANALYZED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN HUMAN LIFE AND SAFETY IS AT STAKE, OR WHEN ALGORITHMIC PROCESSES CAN HAVE DRAMATIC AND UNINTENDED EFFECTS WITHIN BROADER SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP TO PUBLICIZE AND PUSH FORWARD THE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF THESE KINDS OF ALGORITHMS. THE RESEARCH IS ALSO TIGHTLY COUPLED TO THE EDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH GOALS OF THE PROJECT. THE ALGORITHMIC EVOLUTION LAB BUILDS AN ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS TO CONDUCT INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. ACTIVITIES SUCH AS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH WORKSHOPS AND GUEST LECTURES FROM PROMINENT WOMEN IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WILL SERVE THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE GENDER BALANCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND CREATING PATHWAYS TO STEM RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. THE PROJECT WILL APPLY TOOLS FROM THE THEORY OF PARAMETERIZED COMPLEXITY TO EXPLAIN HOW DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY SEARCH OPERATORS INFLUENCE THE SPEED OF ADAPTATION ON COMBINATORIAL LANDSCAPES, AND HOW LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IN TURN INFLUENCES THIS SPEED. EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS AND OTHER OPTIMIZATION HEURISTICS FROM AI ARE ROBUST AND GENERAL-PURPOSE, YET OFTEN COME WITH MANY MODULES AND DESIGN CHOICES. FINDING REASONABLE CONFIGURATIONS REQUIRES A COSTLY, AD-HOC TRIAL-AND-ERROR APPROACH. THE PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY PARAMETERS, BOTH IN PROBLEM STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM DESIGN, THAT ISOLATE THE SOURCE OF EXPONENTIAL COMPLEXITY FOR THE ALGORITHM TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT OPERATORS ON RUNNING TIME. THIS WILL RESULT IN A PRINCIPLED APPROACH TO DESIGNING AND TUNING THESE TECHNIQUES IN PRACTICE. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO OFFER A FRESH VIEW ON TRADITIONAL THEORETICAL WORK IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY BY TACKLING AN OLD PROBLEM FROM A NEW ALGORITHMIC PERSPECTIVE. WRIGHT'S SHIFTING BALANCE THEORY CONTENDS THAT STOCHASTIC PROCESSES SUCH AS GENETIC DRIFT ARE CRITICAL FORCES IN THE DYNAMICS OF ADAPTATION. THIS CONFLICTS WITH THE FISHERIAN VIEW THAT ADAPTATION IS A SIMPLE HILL-CLIMBING PROCESS. BY APPLYING TOOLS FROM THE RUNNING TIME ANALYSIS OF EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS, THIS PROJECT WILL ATTACK THESE QUESTIONS FROM A NOVEL FRAMEWORK BASED ON COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY IN WHICH EFFICIENCY OF ADAPTATION CAN BE MADE RIGOROUS.

THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES OF PHEROMONES CAN DIFFER BETWEEN CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES, IMPLYING RAPID EVOLUTION. HOWEVER, UNLIKE VISUAL SIGNALS LIKE WING PATTERNS OR AUDITORY SIGNALS LIKE MATING SONGS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW NEW CHEMICAL SIGNALS ARISE AND DIVERSIFY. THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE GENETIC AND BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT UNDERLIE THE EVOLUTION OF AN ANTI-APHRODISIAC PHEROMONE PRODUCED BY DROSOPHILA FRUIT FLY SPECIES. THE FINDINGS WILL DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EVOLUTION AT THE CHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR LEVEL CAN LEAD TO ORGANISMAL-SCALE CHANGES IN SOCIAL BEHAVIORS SUCH AS MATE CHOICE. THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES WILL HAVE DIRECT APPLICATION TO THE DESIGN OF PHEROMONE-BASED STRATEGIES TO DISRUPT THE REPRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL PESTS AND INSECTS THAT TRANSMIT DISEASE.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BIOCHEMICAL AND GENETIC PROCESSES THAT SHAPE THE DIVERSIFICATION OF CHEMOSENSORY TRAITS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PHEROMONES ORIGINATE AND EVOLVE. THE STUDY WILL IDENTIFY THE METABOLIC AND GENETIC MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL THE SYNTHESIS AND EVOLUTION OF CH503, A MALE ANTI-APHRODISIAC PHEROMONE PRODUCED IN THE EJACULATORY BULB, WHICH IS PRESENT IN SOME SPECIES OF DROSOPHILA, BUT NOT OTHERS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE EVOLUTION OF THE LIPID PHEROMONE CH503 IS DRIVEN BY DIVERSIFICATION OF SECONDARY METABOLITES AND CHANGES IN THE TISSUE-SPECIFIC ACTIVATION OF LIPID BIOSYNTHESIS GENES. TO UNCOVER MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE RAPID EVOLUTION OF THIS PHEROMONE, MASS SPECTROMETRY, TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS, AND GENETIC MANIPULATION WILL BE USED TO: 1) IDENTIFY AND TRACE THE EVOLUTION OF THE METABOLOME OF THE EJACULATORY BULB IN CH503-PRODUCERS AND NON-PRODUCERS, INCLUDING D. MELANOGASTER, SIX OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME SUBGROUP, AND TWO DISTANTLY RELATED SPECIES; 2) IDENTIFY AND TRACE THE EVOLUTION OF THE GENETIC COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF CH503; AND 3) DETERMINE HOW INTRODUCTION OF A NOVEL BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY TO SPECIES THAT DO NOT PRODUCE CH503 CHANGES THE CHEMICAL PROFILE OF THE EJACULATORY BULB. THE HIGH-SENSITIVITY MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED METHODS FOR LIPID ANALYSIS TO BE DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS THE METABOLOMIC DATA GENERATED, WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER RESEARCHERS.

THE SCIENCE QUESTIONS ARE (SQ1) HOW DOES DIFFUSE AURORAL ELECTRON PRECIPITATION AFFECT THE AURORAL IONOSPHERIC CONDUCTIVITY, HEIGHT-INTEGRATED CONDUCTANCE, FIELD-ALIGNED CURRENTS, AND THE IONOSPHERIC AND INNER MAGNETOSPHERIC ELECTRIC FIELD THROUGH THE ELECTRODYNAMIC MI COUPLING DURING MAGNETIC STORMS? CAN A MAGNETICALLY AND ELECTRICALLY SELF-CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF THE PARTICLE TRANSPORT AND LOSS, INCLUDING DIFFUSE AURORAL PRECIPITATION, ACCOUNT FOR OBSERVED CONDUCTANCE (PFISR), FIELD-ALIGNED CURRENTS (AMPERE), AND ELECTRIC FIELDS (PFISR, DMSP, VAN ALLEN PROBES) DURING STORMS? (SQ2) WHAT ARE THE IONOSPHERIC CONDUCTIVITY AND HEIGHT-INTEGRATED CONDUCTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH REPRESENTATIVE DISCRETE AURORAL ELECTRON PRECIPITATION IN LOCALIZED REGIONS DURING MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES? WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE SUPERIMPOSED DIFFUSE AND LOCALIZED DISCRETE AURORAL ELECTRON PRECIPITATION ON THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERIC ELECTRIC FIELD AND PARTICLE TRANSPORT? TO ADDRESS SQ1, A COUPLING OF THREE MODELS WILL BE USED: (1) THE MAGNETICALLY AND ELECTRICALLY SELF-CONSISTENT RICE CONVECTION MODEL-EQUILIBRIUM (RCM-E) THAT CALCULATES INNER MAGNETOSPHERIC PARTICLE TRANSPORT AND PRECIPITATION DUE TO THE EFFECT OF WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTIONS, (2) THE SUPERTHERMAL ELECTRON TRANSPORT (STET) MODEL THAT WILL MODIFY THE RCM-E PRECIPITATING ELECTRON FLUXES TO INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF BACKSCATTER AND MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS BETWEEN CONJUGATE HEMISPHERES, AND (3) RESULTS FROM THE B3C AURORAL TRANSPORT MODEL THAT COMPUTES ALTITUDINAL PROFILES OF CONDUCTIVITY. TO ADDRESS SQ2, PARAMETERIZED REPRESENTATIVE GAUSSIAN AURORAL ELECTRON DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE USED WITH STET AND THE B3C MODEL TO COMPUTE IONOSPHERIC CONDUCTIVITY. OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS GROUND-BASED PHOTOMETERS AND ALL SKY IMAGING DATA WILL BE USED TO CONSTRAIN THE INTEGRATED ELECTRON ENERGY FLUX, AND THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF THE DISCRETE AURORAL PRECIPITATION WILL BE PARAMETERIZED. SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED TO INCLUDE THE CONDUCTANCE AND POTENTIAL DROPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCRETE AURORA IN A LOCALIZED REGION OVERLAPPING THE BROADER DIFFUSE AURORA TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS ON THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERIC PARTICLE TRANSPORT.

AGGRECAN IS FOUND IN CARTILAGE TISSUE, AND THE DEGRADATION OF AGGRECAN HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE ONSET AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE OSTEOARTHRITIS. OSTEOARTHRITIS IS A DISEASE THAT AFFLICTS THE JOINTS, WHERE THE CARTILAGE TISSUE IN THE JOINT IS DETERIORATED LEADING TO PAIN, INFLAMMATION, AND DYSFUNCTION OF THE JOINT. THIS DISEASE AFFECTS SENIOR CITIZENS IN PARTICULAR, AND IT IS BELIEVED TO AFFECT 10% OF THE POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF 60 AND COSTS THE US ECONOMY OVER $60 BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AGGRECAN MIMETIC POLYMERS ARE SEEN AS A PROMISING APPROACH TO REGENERATIVE TREATMENT FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS. THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING TREATMENTS USING AGGRECAN MIMICS THAT MUST BE OVERCOME. KEY PROPERTIES THE CANDIDATE TREATMENTS MUST POSSESS TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE INJECTABILITY, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, AND IMMOBILITY ONCE IN THE TREATMENT AREA. THIS WORK WILL DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, USING SIMULATION AND MACHINE LEARNING TO DESIGN CANDIDATE POLYMERS THAT POSSESS THE DESIRED PROPERTIES FOR USE IN CARTILAGE TREATMENT. THIS DESIGN FRAMEWORK CAN BE FURTHER UTILIZED TO DESIGN MATERIALS FOR A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES IN HEALTH AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE PI WILL WORK WITH THEIR MENTOR AND INSTITUTION TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION AMONGST UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED TRAINING PROGRAM FOR ASPIRING MATERIALS SCIENTISTS AS WELL AS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AIMED AT PROVIDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH GUIDANCE AND EXPOSURE TO STEM GRADUATE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH. THESE EFFORTS OF THE PI TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN STEM WILL ALSO BE INFORMED BY THEIR PAST PARTICIPATION IN DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION PROGRAMS AND PAST EXPERIENCES AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL FOR DESIGNING AGGRECAN MIMETIC COPOLYMERS, THAT USES COARSE-GRAINED MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, AND IS INFORMED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTAL DATA. THE PROPOSED COPOLYMER WILL BE MADE UP OF A THERMORESPONSIVE COMPONENT AND A CHARGED COMPONENT TO EFFECTIVELY MIMIC THE PROTEOGLYCAN AGGRECAN, WHILE ACHIEVING NECESSARY MATERIAL PROPERTIES FOR USE AS AN INJECTION TREATMENT. THE CANDIDATE MUST BE BIOCOMPATIBLE, INJECTABLE, AND ONCE IN THE TREATMENT AREA, AND MUST REMAIN IMMOBILE IN THE TARGET TISSUE. THE PI PROPOSES A COPOLYMER MADE WITH THE BIOCOMPATIBLE AND CHARGED POLYMER POLY(SODIUM-4-STYRENE SULFONATE) (PSSNA) AND THE THERMORESPONSIVE POLYMER POLY(N-ISOPROPYLACRYLAMIDE) (PNIPAM). THE GOAL IS TO DESIGN A COPOLYMER THAT POSSESSES THE CHARGE DENSITY OF AGGRECAN AND UNDERGOES A SOL-GEL TRANSITION AT PHYSIOLOGICAL TEMPERATURES. THE LATTER WILL ENSURE THAT THE MATERIAL IS INJECTABLE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND IS IMMOBILIZED AT BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE TREATMENT AREA. THE PI WILL DEVELOP A COARSE-GRAINED MODEL FOR THE PROPOSED COPOLYMER, THAT WILL BE PARAMETERIZED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS PROVIDED BY THE COLLABORATOR ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT. THE PI WILL USE THE COARSE-GRAINED MODEL IN MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS TO MODEL COPOLYMERS WITH A VARIETY OF COPOLYMER DESIGN PARAMETERS, SUCH AS THE COPOLYMER ARCHITECTURE, SIDECHAIN GRAFTING DENSITY, SIDE CHAIN LENGTH, AND MOLECULAR WEIGHT. THE SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A DATA-DRIVEN FORWARD AND INVERSE MODEL THAT CAN PREDICT OPTIMAL POLYMER DESIGN FOR DESIRED SOLUTION BEHAVIOR AND POLYMER CHAIN CONFORMATION PROPERTIES. THE SIMULATION AND DATA-DRIVEN MODELS WILL BE USED TO GENERATE CANDIDATE MATERIALS TO SERVE AS POTENTIAL INJECTION TREATMENTS FOR RESTORING CARTILAGE DAMAGED BY THE PROGRESSION OF OSTEOARTHRITIS.

TRACKING STUDENTS INTO COLLEGE, THE PROJECT MEASURES LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF IMPROVED SPATIAL COGNITION RESULTING FROM THE MODIFIED GEOSPATIAL COURSE CURRICULUM. LARGE-SCALE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE OVERWHELMING BENEFIT OF ADVANCED SPATIAL COGNITIVE ABILITIES FOR SUCCESS IN STEM CAREERS. RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPATIAL COGNITIVE TRAINING FOR DEVELOPING THESE SKILLS IN THE CONTEXT OF SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULA. WHAT IS LACKING ARE THE DATA TO CONNECT THESE SEPARATE LINES OF RESEARCH: DOES SPATIAL COGNITIVE EDUCATION YIELD LASTING EFFECTS ON COGNITION THAT INFLUENCE FUTURE SUCCESS IN STEM FIELDS. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES, AND FURTHER DEVELOPS, A SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL SPATIAL STEM CURRICULUM TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT SUPPORT LONG-TERM LEARNING THAT BUILDS OVER TIME, DEMONSTRATED BY TRACKING PROGRESS INTO COLLEGE. GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT SPATIAL COGNITION IS A DETERMINANT OF SUCCESS IN STEM, BROADENING ACCESS TO SPATIAL LEARNING IS CRITICAL TO BROADENING THE GATEWAY TO STEM ACHIEVEMENT. CURRENTLY, SPATIALLY-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES (E.G., EXTRACURRICULAR SCIENCE ACTIVITIES) OFTEN REQUIRE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ESTABLISH AN EMPIRICAL BASIS FOR BROAD ADOPTION OF SPATIAL CURRICULA SO THAT MORE STUDENTS RECEIVE SPATIAL INSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS TO YIELD MORE EFFECTIVE STEM CURRICULA AND SHORTEN DEVELOPMENT TIME. FURTHER, THIS PROJECT CAN PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS FOR BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN STEM AND WILL POINT TO NEURAL TARGETS FOR INTERVENTION, IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF SEX AND STEM-RELATED ANXIETIES ON CONCEPTUAL LEARNING IN THE BRAIN, AND TESTING THE EFFICACY OF SPATIAL EDUCATION FOR REDUCING DISPARITIES. MOST BROADLY, THE RESEARCH HAS POTENTIAL TO BOLSTER SPATIAL ABILITY IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE U.S. STEM WORKFORCE, WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND DIVERSE CAREER PATHS. THE PROJECT USES NEURAL DATA, IN COMBINATION WITH BEHAVIORAL TESTS, TO MEASURE AND COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES AND TO IMPROVE THE CURRICULUM ITSELF. THE RESEARCH BUILDS ON A FOUNDATION OF WORK BY THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM, INCLUDING YEARS OF CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, NEURAL DATA ANALYSIS, AND EXAMINATION OF THE COGNITIVE AND NEURAL BENEFITS OF SPATIAL COGNITIVE EDUCATION. THE INSIGHTS PROVIDED BY THIS PROJECT ALLOW THE INVESTIGATORS TO ADDRESS SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS, INCLUDING HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY TRAIN AND UTILIZE SPATIAL COGNITION IN EDUCATION, WHAT LONG-TERM NEURAL AND COGNITIVE CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SPATIAL LEARNING DURING ADOLESCENCE, HOW CAN NEURAL DATA BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE, AND WHICH INSTRUCTIONAL CHANGES BENEFIT STUDENT LEARNING AND MOTIVATION TO PURSUE FUTURE STEM ENDEAVORS. BEYOND TESTING THE EFFICACY OF SPATIAL EDUCATION, THIS PROJECT ALSO GENERATES NEW METHODS FOR DECODING THE NEURAL SIGNALS THAT REFLECT LEARNING AND CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING. FURTHER, THE PROJECT PUTS THESE METHODS TO USE IN COMPARING DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SPATIAL CURRICULUM ON THE BASIS OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM NEURAL AND COGNITIVE CHANGES. BY COMPARING TRADITIONAL LEARNING OUTCOMES, NOVEL NEURAL MEASURES, AND STUDENT MOTIVATION FOR PURSUING STEM DISCIPLINES, THE PROJECT PROVIDES A NEW, POWERFUL EVIDENTIARY BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING WHEN CHOOSING AMONG INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES. THIS PROJECT BUILDS NEW CAPACITY FOR FOCUS-GROUP TESTING THAT INCLUDES NEURAL DATA TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SPECIFIC AND ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPATIALLY-ENRICHED SCIENCE CURRICULA.

THE GOAL OF THE SPRF PROGRAM IS TO PREPARE PROMISING, EARLY CAREER DOCTORAL-LEVEL SCIENTISTS FOR SCIENTIFIC CAREERS IN ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY OR PRIVATE SECTOR, AND GOVERNMENT. SPRF AWARDS INVOLVE TWO YEARS OF TRAINING UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS AND ENCOURAGE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS TO PERFORM INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. NSF SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE PARTICIPATION OF SCIENTISTS FROM ALL SEGMENTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, IN ITS RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES; THE POSTDOCTORAL PERIOD IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN ATTAINING THIS GOAL. EACH POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW MUST ADDRESS IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT ADVANCE THEIR RESPECTIVE DISCIPLINARY FIELDS. UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF DR. ALDER KELEMAN SAXENA AT NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY, THIS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AWARD SUPPORTS AN EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST INVESTIGATING THE INTERLINKING ISSUES OF NUTRITIONAL SECURITY, HUNGER REDUCTION, AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE. AS THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCES INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES (E.G., HEATWAVES, DROUGHTS, WILDFIRES, AND FLOODING) ON LOCAL ACCESS TO NUTRITIONAL FOODS IS FUNDAMENTAL. FOOD CROPS THAT EVOLVE AND ADAPT ARE CENTRAL TO SECURING FOOD ACCESS IN RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PROJECT UNDERTAKES THESE INTERRELATED ISSUES, EXAMINING THE WAYS IN WHICH LOCALLY-BASED COMMUNITY SEED BANKS ARE PROTECTING CROP DIVERSITY WHILE INCREASING LOCAL ACCESS TO NUTRITIONAL, HEALTHY FOODS. COMMUNITY SEED BANKS CAN SERVE AS CENTRAL NODES THAT 1) CONNECT PEOPLE TO FOOD RESOURCES, 2) STEWARD THE ENVIRONMENT, AND 3) PRESERVE AND GROW IMPORTANT REGIONAL FOOD CROPS. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THESE ROLES, THERE IS LITTLE TO NO RESEARCH ON HOW THEY ACTUALLY SERVE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. THIS UNDERTAKING FILLS THIS GAP, EXAMINING COMMUNITY SEED BANKS IN AREAS OF HIGH POVERTY AND HUNGER, TO TRACE THE PATHWAYS FROM SEED BANKS TO FOOD ACCESS AND NUTRITION. THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE ORIGINAL DATA ON THESE PATHWAYS, ILLUSTRATING WHERE, HOW, WHEN, AND WHO BENEFITS FROM LOCAL SEED BANKS. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS UNDERTAKING IS TO IDENTIFY EXISTING AGROBIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION INITIATIVES IN MOST IMPACTED REGIONS OF THE US, LINKING THEM TO HOW THEY FACILITATE COMMUNITY NETWORKS FOR THE GOAL OF PROVIDING AND INCREASING ACCESS TO FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITY. THIS PROJECT UNDERTAKES A FOUR-PART RESEARCH DESIGN, INCLUDING NETWORK ANALYSIS AND PATHWAY MAPPING TO DETERMINE THE FLOW OF SEEDS TO AND AWAY FROM COMMUNITY SEED BANKS, IDENTIFYING THE VARIOUS ACTORS INVOLVED, THEIR LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION, AND OUTCOMES OF SEED AND BENEFIT SHARING TO THE COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL IDENTIFY A TYPOLOGY OF SEED-TO-FOOD PATHWAYS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE BACKYARD GARDEN PROJECTS, COMMUNITY GARDENS, COMMUNITY SUPPORTED- AGRICULTURE, FREE COMMUNITY FRIDGES, EDUCATIONAL SPACES, SCHOOL GARDENS, AND OTHERS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY SEED BANK ORGANIZERS IN EACH CASE SITE AREA WILL BE INTERVIEWED, WITH ALL INTERVIEWS CODED AND HOUSED IN QUALITATIVE DATA CODING SOFTWARE. FINALLY, FOCUS GROUPS WILL BE HELD IN EACH IDENTIFIED CASE SITE TO ASSESS PERCEPTIONS OF COMMUNITY SEED BANKS AND THEIR PATHWAYS, ALONG WITH HOW COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES IDENTIFY THESE PATHWAYS. THIS RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE 1) METHODS FOR EXAMINING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CSBS SUPPORT FOOD SECURITY/NUTRITION THROUGH EXPANDING ACCESS TO AGROBIODIVERSITY; 2) MULTIPLE DATA SETS, INCLUDING INDEXES OF LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY CONSERVED SEED VARIETIES, ECOSYSTEMS IN WHICH THEY ARE USED, AND HOW COMMUNITIES USE THEM; AND 3) NETWORK ANALYSES INTRODUCING A TYPOLOGY OF ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT THE FLOW OF AGROBIODIVERSITY TO AND FROM COMMUNITIES. BROADLY, THIS POSTDOCTORAL PROJECT DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO GLOBAL CALLS FOR INCREASING RESEARCH ON THE STATUS OF AGROBIODIVERSITY. FURTHERMORE, IT CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING THE INTERSECTIONS OF SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS WITH FOOD SECURITY/ACCESS/AND NUTRITION.

IN FACT, THESE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES MAY INADVERTENTLY CREATE AND PROMOTE INEQUITIES AMONG DIFFERENT STUDENT GROUPS, PARTICULARLY IN LARGE ENROLLMENT COURSES, BUT THESE ISSUES HAVE LARGELY BEEN UNEXPLORED. THIS POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROJECT SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF GRADING PRACTICES ON SELF-CONCEPT AND STEM PERSISTENCE WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON RURAL AND NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. THE PROJECT HAS PROMISE TO PRODUCE NEW INSIGHTS ABOUT EQUITABLE CLASSROOM AND GRADING PRACTICES FOR RURAL AND NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF HIGH ENROLLMENT GATEWAY COURSES. IN ADDITION TO CONDUCTING THE RESEARCH PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATOR WILL BUILD STEM EDUCATION RESEARCH CAPACITY IN QUANTITATIVE METHODS AND APPROACHES THROUGH AN EXPLICIT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THIS PROJECT'S RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NONTRADITIONAL AND RURAL STUDENTS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL GRADING WHEN USED IN HIGH ENROLLMENT, GATEWAY STEM COURSES. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL USE A MIXED-METHODS, COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH APPROACH WITH THREE OBJECTIVES. FIRST IS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GRADING STRUCTURES AND NONTRADITIONAL AND RURAL STUDENTS? SELF-CONCEPT AND INTENTIONS TO PERSIST IN HIGH ENROLLMENT, GATEWAY STEM COURSES. SECOND IS TO CHARACTERIZE HOW ASPECTS OF TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE GRADING SCHEMES INFLUENCE NONTRADITIONAL AND RURAL STUDENTS? ACADEMIC SELF-CONCEPT AND INTENTIONS TO PERSIST IN STEM. THIRD IS TO DEVELOP EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED APPROACHES OF EQUITABLE GRADING STRATEGIES THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO HIGH ENROLLMENT STEM CLASSROOMS AND ARE PARTICULARLY SUPPORTIVE FOR RURAL STUDENTS AND STUDENTS THAT IDENTIFY AS NONTRADITIONAL. THE FINDINGS COULD PROVIDE FACULTY WITH PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT AND GRADING APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC INEQUITABLE PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH GRADING AND CREATE MORE EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR STUDENTS BROADLY. THE PROJECT RESPONDS TO THE STEM EDUCATION POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP (STEM ED PRF) PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO ENHANCE THE RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND PRACTICES OF RECENT DOCTORATES IN STEM, STEM EDUCATION, EDUCATION, AND RELATED DISCIPLINES TO ADVANCE THEIR PREPARATION TO ENGAGE IN FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED RESEARCH THAT ADVANCES KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE FIELD.

SOME OF THOSE ATOMS CAN MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE BONE ITSELF; MORE SPECIFICALLY THEY CAN GET INSIDE THE HARD PART OF YOUR BONES WHICH IS MADE UP OF A MINERAL CALLED APATITE. THE MOVEMENT OF THESE ATOMS INTO THE APATITE CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOUR BONES WORK, MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO BREAK. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE APATITE MINERALS IN YOUR BONES ARE EXTREMELY SMALL, IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY WHERE THESE HEAVY METAL IONS GO AND HOW THEY AFFECT BONE STRENGTH. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS THEREFORE TO USE A COMBINATION OF COMPUTER MODELLING AND EXPERIMENTS USING VERY POWERFUL X-RAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE METAL ATOMS GO IN THE APATITE MINERAL AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAKE THE BONE MORE BREAKABLE. BY COMBINING COMPUTER MODELS AND EXPERIMENTS, TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW METAL ATOMS INTERACT WITH BONE APATITE AND PREDICT HOW THOSE ATOMS AFFECT BONE STRENGTH IN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH COBALT AND CHROMIUM CONTAINING BONE IMPLANTS. INTEGRATED WITH THIS RESEARCH, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL STRIVE TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAKE STUDENTS MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THEIR SCIENTIFIC ABILITIES. THIS WILL BE DONE BY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO WORK IN THE LAB, BY TEACHING INCLUSIVE CLASSES THAT REACH BROAD AUDIENCES, AND BY ACTING AS ROLE MODELS FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT OFTEN SEE PEOPLE LIKE THEM (WOMEN AND RACIAL MINORITIES) IN SCIENTIFIC ROLES. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: DEGRADATION OF COBALT (CO) AND CHROMIUM (CR) CONTAINING IMPLANTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RELEASE OF HEAVY METAL IONS AND AN INCREASE IN BONE FRACTURE RISK. SINCE BONE IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF APATITE MINERAL WHICH EXHIBITS A HIGH PROPENSITY FOR CATIONIC SUBSTITUTIONS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE BONE MATRIX IS ABSORBING THESE IONS RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AND MECHANICS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE INCORPORATION OF COBALT (CO) AND CHROMIUM (CR) IN THE NEAR-IMPLANT BONE PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROMOTING FRACTURE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN STUDYING NANO-SIZED APATITES, THERE REMAIN SEVERAL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THIS PROCESS INCLUDING HOW CO AND CR SUBSTITUTE INTO APATITE, HOW THE IONS AFFECT THE APATITE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, AND WHAT CO AND CR CONCENTRATIONS ARE NEEDED TO AFFECT BONE FRACTURE. TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, AN AB INITIO-BASED MODEL OF APATITE CRYSTALS WITH CO AND CR SUBSTITUTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PREDICT THE CHANGE IN CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF APATITE CRYSTALS AT THE NANOSCALE. THESE PREDICTIONS WILL BE VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES USING BIOMIMETIC APATITE SYSTEMS AND HIGH-ENERGY SYNCHROTRON X-RAY DIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. THESE DATA WILL BE COMBINED TO CREATE MULTISCALE MODELS OF APATITE CRYSTALS TO STUDY FRACTURE INITIATION PROCESSES DUE TO CO AND CR SUBSTITUTIONS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY CAN BENEFIT MILLIONS OF NORTH AMERICANS WITH COBALT-CHROME IMPLANTS BY CREATING A NEW AVENUE FOR TREATMENT DEVELOPMENTS TO MINIMIZE FRACTURE IN THIS ALREADY AT-RISK POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL FACILITATE THE TUNABILITY OF APATITE BIOMATERIALS FOR FUTURE BONE GRAFT AND SCAFFOLDING APPLICATIONS. INTEGRATED WITH THE RESEARCH, IS AN EDUCATIONAL PLAN WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE SELF-EFFICACY IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE FOR A VARIETY OF STUDENTS.

LIKE MANY INSTITUTIONS, NAU?S GRADUATION AND RETENTION RATES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ARE LOWER THAN THOSE OF STUDENTS FROM THE DOMINANT POPULATION. STEM IDENTITY, WHICH ENCOMPASSES A STUDENT?S SENSE OF BELONGING TO STEM FIELDS AND THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN ABILITIES, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF RETENTION AND SUCCESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STEM MAJORS, AND STUDENTS WHO ARE FROM MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS TEND TO HAVE LESS ROBUST STEM IDENTITIES THAN STUDENTS FROM THE DOMINANT POPULATION. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT TEACHING FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, RESEARCH EXPERIENCE, AND ARTISTIC OUTLETS CAN ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONGER STEM IDENTITIES. THIS PROJECT WILL COMBINE THESE THREE APPROACHES TO TEST WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN ANY OR ALL OF THESE PIECES CONTRIBUTE TO A STRONGER STEM IDENTITY, RETENTION, AND GRADUATION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A MORE ROBUST PICTURE OF HOW STUDENTS FROM MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS DEVELOP THEIR STEM IDENTITIES, WHICH WILL ALLOW NAU AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO BETTER FOSTER THOSE IDENTITIES, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO INCREASED RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES IN STEM FIELDS. THE PROJECT WILL FOSTER STEM IDENTITY IN STUDENTS THROUGH THREE APPROACHES: (1) A SECOND-YEAR SEMINAR (SYS) COURSE FOCUSED ON SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR, CRITICAL DISCOURSE ABOUT SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION IN STEM, AND ACTIONS STUDENTS CAN TAKE TO EMPOWER THEIR OWN LEARNING; (2) A SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCE (SRE) FOCUSED ON THE EARLY STAGES OF RESEARCH, INCLUDING PLACE-BASED OBSERVATIONS, DEVELOPING RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES, AND DATA COLLECTION AND INTERPRETATION; AND (3) A CREATIVE ARTS COURSE IN WHICH THE STUDENTS REFLECT UPON THEIR RESEARCH EXPERIENCES THROUGH A CREATIVE MEDIUM. THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM, WE WILL USE SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS TO MEASURE STUDENTS? STEM IDENTITIES, AND AFTER THEY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, WE WILL TRACK THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR DEGREE COMPLETION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALL STUDENTS WILL SEE GAINS IN THEIR STEM IDENTITIES, AND THAT THE STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN ALL THREE PHASES OF THE PROGRAM WILL HAVE STRONGER STEM IDENTITIES AND WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE WITH A STEM DEGREE, THAN THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN ONLY ONE OR TWO PHASES. THESE RESULTS WILL HELP HSIS UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN BETTER SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF STUDENTS? STEM IDENTITIES AS THEY PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR STEM MAJORS.

THE END-PLEISTOCENE (11,700 YEARS AGO) TO MID-HOLOCENE (5,000 YEARS AGO) PERIOD OF MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA REPRESENTS A CRITICAL INTERVAL IN THE CO-EVOLUTION OF CLIMATE, NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS, AND HUMAN SOCIETIES. THIS PERIOD INCLUDES THE TERMINATION OF THE LAST GREAT ICE AGE ? 10,000 YEARS AGO AND A DYNAMIC AND VARIABLE ASIAN MONSOON. ASSOCIATED INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION LIKELY INFLUENCED THE BIOTIC RESOURCES OF THE REGION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN LAND USE BY HUMAN POPULATIONS AT THIS TIME LIKELY RESULTED IN LANDSCAPE CHANGES FROM NEW AGRARIAN AND SUBSISTENCE-BASED PRACTICES (INCLUDING FOREST CLEARANCE) THAT COULD HAVE FURTHER IMPACTED FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES AND AFFECTED REGIONAL CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY.

LEARNING IN AND FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING (LIFEWAYS) IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT INDIGENOUS STEWARDSHIP HAS SUSTAINED COMMUNITIES ON THESE LANDS SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. THIS PROJECT IS COLLABORATIVELY LED BY THE INDIGENOUS EDUCATION INSTITUTE AND OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY?S STEM RESEARCH CENTER, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NATIVE PATHWAYS AND THE REIMAGINE RESEARCH GROUP, SWINOMISH INDIAN TRIBAL COMMUNITY, OREGON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, WORLD FORESTRY CENTER, AND A NATIONAL PARK NETWORK IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. THE AIM OF THIS PARTNERSHIP IS TO DEEPEN THE INFORMAL LEARNING FIELD?S UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING ARE CURRENTLY OR CAN BE INCLUDED IN OUTDOOR LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS PARKS, NATURE PRESERVES, AND TRIBAL LANDS. THE PROJECT WILL SHARE PRACTICES THAT CENTER INDIGENOUS WORLDVIEWS TO BUILD AWARENESS OF THEIR VALUE AND ENHANCE STEM LEARNING IN OUTDOOR SETTINGS. THESE APPROACHES ENGAGE NATIVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN CONTINUING THEIR TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES, AND HELP NON-NATIVE AUDIENCES LEARN FROM THE DYNAMIC INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN AUTHENTIC, RESPECTFUL WAYS. CONVENTIONAL OUTDOOR EDUCATION IS MOSTLY GROUNDED IN WESTERN CONCEPTS OF ?CONSERVATION? AND ?PRESERVATION? THAT POSITION HUMANS AS ACTING SEPARATELY FROM NATURE. THIS RESEARCH IN SERVICE TO PRACTICE PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY ?WISE PRACTICES? THAT HONOR INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING, AND INVESTIGATE CURRENT CAPACITIES, BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMPLIFYING INDIGENOUS VOICES IN OUTDOOR EDUCATION. A TEAM OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS WILL DRAW UPON INDIGENOUS AND WESTERN RESEARCH PARADIGMS.

THE ARCTIC IS ONE OF THE FASTEST WARMING REGIONS OF THE PLANET AND LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT NATURAL SYSTEMS IN THIS REGION ARE UNDERGOING SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES. OBSERVED CHANGES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC, WHERE INCREASES IN OCEAN TEMPERATURE, DECREASES IN SEA ICE EXTENT, AND CHANGES IN CURRENTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ALONGSIDE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE IN SEDIMENTS ON THE SEAFLOOR. CHANGES IN THESE COMMUNITIES LIKELY WILL HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS ON FISHERIES AND SEABIRD AND MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS THAT RELY ON FOOD FROM THE SEAFLOOR. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXAMINE COINCIDENT CHANGES IN SEAFLOOR BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS AS RECORDED IN SAMPLES COLLECTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES TO UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PROJECT WILL TEST HOW WELL OBSERVATIONAL DATA COLLECTED ANNUALLY FOR DECADES CAN BE USED TO MAKE FORECASTS OF HOW MARINE SYSTEMS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. A SECONDARY GOAL IS TO ASSESS HOW WELL ONGOING SAMPLING EFFORTS MAY BE ABLE TO DETECT BIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS. ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC ALSO WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON SUBSISTENCE HARVESTS OF WALRUSES AND BEARDED SEALS. BY HELPING TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT, EXPLAIN, AND PREDICT CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS, THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES, WHILE MITIGATING SOCIAL IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS PROJECT ALSO WILL COMBINE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION BY PROVIDING INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN POLAR BIOLOGY, MODELING, STATISTICS, AND DATA SCIENCE TO STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS AND FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THESE FIELDS, INCLUDING INTERNS FROM RURAL APPALACHIA, UNDERGRADUATES, AND AN EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST. LASTLY, WE WILL SHARE RESEARCH OUTCOMES AND ACQUIRE SHARED KNOWLEDGE FROM INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION. 2. BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES FOUND IN SEAFLOOR SEDIMENTS OF THE PACIFIC ARCTIC ARE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE, INFLUENCE ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES, AND ARE CRITICAL FOOD RESOURCES FOR MARINE MAMMALS AND BIRDS. THESE SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, AND RECENT OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SHIFTS IN TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN OCEAN TEMPERATURE, DECREASES IN SEA ICE EXTENT, AND CHANGES IN CURRENTS. CHANGES IN PACIFIC ARCTIC SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS ON SEABIRD AND MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS, ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, AND FISHERIES. HOWEVER, IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN AND PREDICT RESPONSES OF ARCTIC MARINE SYSTEMS TO RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE. IN REMOTE, DATA-LIMITED ECOSYSTEMS LIKE THE ARCTIC SEAFLOOR, WHERE DIRECT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION ARE DIFFICULT, CORRELATIVE MODELS ARE OFTEN USED TO LINK BIOLOGICAL PATTERNS TO ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND TO MAKE FORECASTS OF ECOSYSTEM TRAJECTORIES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE PERFORMED RIGOROUS TESTS OF THE ABILITY OF THESE SO-CALLED ?SPACE-FOR-TIME SUBSTITUTION? APPROACHES TO PREDICT CHANGES IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, IN LARGE PART DUE TO A LACK OF CONTEMPORARY DATASETS WITH SUFFICIENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COVERAGE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE LACK A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THRESHOLDS, WHERE INCREMENTAL CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT RESULT IN SUDDEN AND FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, IN DRIVING BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. TO ADDRESS THESE HURDLES, THIS PROJECT WILL (1) ANALYZE MULTI-DECADAL TIME SERIES OF PAIRED BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN THE NORTHERN BERING AND CHUKCHI SEAS SINCE THE 1980S TO CHARACTERIZE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND RESPONSES OF ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT MARINE SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES; (2) TEST THE EXTENT TO WHICH OBSERVATIONAL TIME SERIES CAN INFORM FORECASTS OF CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS; AND (3) EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF ONGOING SAMPLING EFFORTS TO DETECT BIOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN DOING SO, THIS PROJECT WILL IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN, DETECT, AND PREDICT BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES IN CHANGING ARCTIC ENVIRONMENTS AND ADDRESS ASSOCIATED KNOWLEDGE GAPS USING NOVEL MODELING METHODS. THE ARCTIC IS ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY WARMING REGIONS ON THE PLANET AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON HIGH BIOMASS SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHERN BERING AND CHUKCHI SEAS WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POTENTIAL NORTHWARD FISHERIES EXPANSION AS WELL AS CO-MANAGEMENT OF SUBSISTENCE HARVESTS OF WALRUSES AND BEARDED SEALS BY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT, EXPLAIN, AND PREDICT CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS, AND IN DOING SO WE WILL SUPPORT EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES, WHILE MITIGATING SOCIAL IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL INTEGRATE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN MULTIPLE WAYS BY: (I) MENTORING SUMMER INTERNS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ATTENDING A LOCAL COLLEGE IN RURAL APPALACHIA; (II) PROVIDING RESEARCH EXPERIENCES TO UNDERGRADUATES THROUGH AN EXISTING RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES PROGRAM; AND (III) TRAINING OF A GRADUATE STUDENT IN SPATIAL MODELING, MARINE SCIENCE, AND GLOBAL CHANGE ECOLOGY.

THE WORK WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX PSYCHO-SOCIAL PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE PERSISTENT UNDERREPRESENTATION OF LATINX AND HISPANIC STUDENTS ACROSS STEM FIELDS AND THE EXISTENCE OF A GENDER GAP THAT IS LARGER THAN FOUND IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. LATINX AND HISPANIC STUDENTS IN STEM COME FROM THE FASTEST GROWING ETHNIC MINORITY IN THE UNITED STATES.

EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR SOCIOECONOMIC VITALITY AND BROAD QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT. STRONG, RELIABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SPURS PRIVATE-SECTOR INNOVATION, GROWS THE ECONOMY, CREATES JOBS, MAKES PUBLIC-SECTOR SERVICE PROVISION MORE EFFICIENT, STRENGTHENS COMMUNITIES, PROMOTES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, PROTECTS THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCES NATIONAL SECURITY, AND FUELS AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS REQUIRES EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES. SAI FOCUSES ON HOW KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN REASONING AND DECISION-MAKING, GOVERNANCE, AND SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PROCESSES ENABLES THE BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE OF EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IMPROVES LIVES AND SOCIETY AND BUILDS ON ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING. PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO LIVE BASED ON MANY CONSIDERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS, THIS MAY INCLUDE SUCH FEATURES AS AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC GOODS, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND LOCAL CLIMATE. ONE VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FLOODING. LOCATIONS VARY BY FLOOD RISK. SUCH RISK EVOLVES BECAUSE OF CHANGING CLIMATE AND BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT INVESTMENTS IN FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS SAI RESEARCH PROJECT EXAMINES THE DECISION MAKING OF PEOPLE RESIDING IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES REGARDING THEIR RESIDENTIAL LOCATION CHOICES WHEN THREATENED BY CHANGING FLOOD RISK CONDITIONS. INVESTMENTS IN FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN TURN PREVIOUSLY RISKY AREAS INTO SAFER LOCATIONS. THE SAFETY PROVIDED BY COASTAL FLOOD BARRIERS MAY, IN TURN, INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR LOCAL HOUSING. A SOCIETAL CONSEQUENCE IS THAT REAL ESTATE PRICES ARE DRIVEN UP, AND LOW- AND MIDDLE-CLASS RESIDENTS ARE DRIVEN OUT. THIS OUTCOME MAY FURTHER EXACERBATE DISPARITIES IN HOME OWNERSHIP ACROSS INCOME STRATA AND LEAD TO THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW SOURCE OF SOCIAL INEQUITY. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A FRAMEWORK INTEGRATING RISK MODELING WITH ECONOMIC DECISIONS AND SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL MODELS. THE INTEGRATIVE APPROACH BRINGS CLARITY TO VARIOUS COASTAL PROTECTION OPTIONS IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY. IT ALSO HELPS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DECISIONS REGARDING DIFFERENT RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES CAN BEST ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF RACIALLY, ETHNICALLY, AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. THE DESIGN OF FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS OFTEN DRIVEN BY HYDRAULIC AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING MODELS TO ASSESS AND VALIDATE BASELINE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS SIMULATE FUTURE RISK AT THE PARCEL LEVEL. THIS PROJECT EXTENDS THAT APPROACH BY INTEGRATING TWO ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES DRAWN FROM THE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. ONE IS AN ECONOMETRIC SORTING MODEL THAT USES RISK PROFILES TO MODEL PREFERENCES FOR LOCATION CHOICES BASED ON SALES DATA OF OWNER-OCCUPIED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. THE OTHER IS BASED ON SOCIAL BEHAVIOR MODELS THAT IDENTIFY RESIDENTS? RISK PERCEPTIONS AND UNCOVER HOW RISK PREFERENCES ARE AFFECTED BY BELIEFS, INFORMATION AND OTHER FACTORS NOT CAPTURED BY THE ECONOMIC SORTING MODEL. THESE APPROACHES ARE INTEGRATED TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGE IN WELFARE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION AND THE DISTRIBUTIONAL EQUITY FOR A SET OF RISK PROFILE SCENARIOS INVOLVING DIFFERENT STORM SURGE BARRIER TYPES AND CURRENT AND FUTURE STORM CLIMATOLOGY AND SEA LEVELS. THE RISK PROFILES AND WELFARE METRICS ARE FURTHER REFINED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF END-USERS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE DESIGN OF A COASTAL BARRIER SYSTEM.

YET THE PLETHORA OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF BPIS AND PERSISTENT CHALLENGES FACED BY BPIS COMPLICATE A STRONG GRASP OF THEIR IMPACT. NOT UNDERSTANDING THE ASPECTS THAT MAKE BPIS EFFECTIVE, LIMITS THEIR POTENTIAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. BPIS ARE OFTEN IMPLEMENTED WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, WHICH ARE COMPLEX SYSTEMS WITH INTRICATE DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND FACTORS. THEREFORE, TO GAUGE THE IMPACT OF BPIS IT IS NECESSARY TO ADOPT SYSTEMS APPROACHES THAT ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH DYNAMIC COMPLEXITY. THIS PROJECT ADOPTS TWO WELL-ESTABLISHED COMPLEX SYSTEMS METHODS TO BRING THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL VALUE TO HARNESS THE IMPACT OF BPIS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS: (1) QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (QCA) TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE COMPLEX DYNAMICS AND DISTINCT CONFIGURATIONS OF FACTORS THAT LEAD TO THE OUTCOMES TARGETED BY A BPI; AND (2) SYSTEMS DYNAMICS MODELING (SDM) TO REFINE THE THEORY OF DRIVERS AND BARRIERS TO THE BPI GOALS. THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE THE REFINEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THEORIES THAT ADVANCE WOMEN FACULTY IN ENGINEERING AND IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND AREAS THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED FOR WOMEN?S SUCCESS. THE GOALS OF THIS TWO-PHASE PROJECT ARE TO (1) TEST THE CAPABILITIES OF QCA AND SDM IN REFINING THEORIES FOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, AND (2) INNOVATE IN THE TRANSLATION OF QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE INTO QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT COULD SUPPORT THE COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING OF BPIS IMPACT. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON AN EXEMPLARY, WELL-ESTABLISHED BPI CASE: THE ADVANCE INITIATIVES TO INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF WOMEN FACULTY IN ENGINEERING. IN PHASE 1, ACKER?S INEQUALITY REGIMES WILL BE USED AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA WILL BE COLLECTED FROM 15 RESEARCH ONE (R1) INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE EARLY ADVANCE GRANTEES AND 15 COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE NOT. QUALITATIVE DATA WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO QUANTITATIVE MEASURES THROUGH CONTENT ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS. QCA MODELS COULD IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT THEORETICAL PATHS LEADING TO OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF WOMEN, PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. IN PHASE 2, THE THEORY OF ADVANCE IMPACT WILL BE FURTHER REFINED THROUGH SDM. FIRST, BY IDENTIFYING DYNAMICS IN THE SYSTEM ILLUSTRATED IN CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAMS (CLDS) THROUGH QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM A SUBSET OF THE SELECTED INSTITUTIONS IN PHASE 1; AND SECOND, BY ENRICHING AND STRENGTHENING THE DEVELOPED CLDS THROUGH GROUP BASED MODELING PERFORMED IN FOCUS GROUPS. THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE (1) REFINED THEORIES OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN FACULTY IN ENGINEERING, INCLUDING POTENTIALLY NEW AND CONFIRMED CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS IDENTIFICATION OF PERSISTING BARRIERS AND POINTS OF LEVERAGE FOR WOMEN?S SUCCESS, (2) METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN TRANSLATING QUALITATIVE DATA TO QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND THE USE OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS METHODS TO STUDY INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.

BECAUSE ACTIVE SEISMICITY OCCURS ALONG FAULTS THAT CAN BE EXPRESSED AT OR HIDDEN BELOW EARTH?S SURFACE, THE NATURE AND HISTORY OF THESE ENIGMATIC STRUCTURES REMAINS DEBATED. SEVERAL COMPETING GEOLOGIC MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THAT LINK THE SEISMICITY AT DEPTH WITH FAULTS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES EXPRESSED AT EARTH?S SURFACE. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THESE DEBATES THROUGH FIELDWORK TO MAP FAULT RELATIONSHIPS AND MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATED SEDIMENTARY BASIN DEPOSITS THAT RECORD THE UPLIFT AND EROSION HISTORY OF ACTIVELY GROWING ANDEAN RANGES. A VARIETY OF GEOCHRONOLOGIC AND LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGIC ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF DEFORMATION ACROSS THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES. RESULTS WILL BE INTEGRATED USING COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO HELP RESOLVE THE DEBATED GEOLOGIC HISTORY FOR THESE ANDEAN RANGES. NEW FIELD AND ANALYTICAL RECORDS OF LONG-TERM FAULT DEFORMATION WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH GEOPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS AND DECADES OF EARTHQUAKE DATA WITH THE HELP OF COLLABORATING ARGENTINIAN SCIENTISTS. THIS WILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TECTONIC FORCES ARE PARTITIONED AMONG DEEP AND SURFICIAL GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND WHICH FAULTS MAY GENERATE LARGE MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKES, INFORMATION THAT IS CRITICAL FOR ASSESSMENTS OF ANDEAN EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT HUMAN POPULATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENTIFIC GOALS OF THE RESEARCH, THE AWARD SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE ENGAGEMENT OF DIVERSE AND HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED HIGH SCHOOL, UNDERGRADUATE, AND PHD-LEVEL STUDENTS IN GEOSCIENCE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. THIS WILL INVOLVE MENTORING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS AND CREATING A PLACE-BASED EDUCATIONAL VIRTUAL FIELD TRIP THROUGH THE WESTERN USA AND FIELD AREA IN ARGENTINA. TECTONIC STRESSES ASSOCIATED WITH FLAT SLAB SUBDUCTION HAVE DRIVEN DEFORMATION 800 KM INBOARD ACROSS THE BROKEN FORELAND OF WEST-CENTRAL ARGENTINA. ONGOING SHORTENING ACCOMMODATED WITHIN THE OVERLAPPING THIN-SKINNED AND BASEMENT-INVOLVED STRUCTURAL PROVINCES MAKES THIS BROKEN FORELAND REGION ONE OF THE MOST SEISMICALLY ACTIVE PLACES ON EARTH. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE STRUCTURAL OR KINEMATIC LINKS BETWEEN THE THIN-SKINNED CENTRAL PRECORDILLERA, THE SIERRAS PAMPEANAS BASEMENT UPLIFTS, OR THE ENIGMATIC THRUST FRONT OF THE EASTERN PRECORDILLERA STRUCTURAL DOMAIN. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS AIM TO RESOLVE THE TEMPORAL AND KINEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG STRUCTURES BY (1) DETERMINING THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF DEFORMATION IN THE EASTERN PRECORDILLERA THRUST FRONT AND (2) INTERROGATING HOW SPATIAL PATTERNS IN EXHUMATIONAL COOLING AND SUBSIDENCE COINCIDE WITH PREDICTIONS BASED ON THE VARIOUS STRUCTURAL GEOMETRIES AND KINEMATICS PROPOSED FOR THE REGION. THEIR RESEARCH PLAN WILL INTEGRATE GEOLOGIC AND STRUCTURAL MAPPING, BASIN ANALYSIS, GEO- AND THERMOCHRONOLOGY, AND FLEXURAL THERMOKINEMATIC MODELING TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HYPOTHESIZED STRUCTURAL MODELS. EVALUATING SPATIAL-TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE SEISMICALLY ACTIVE, STRUCTURAL DOMAINS IN ARGENTINA WILL INFORM MODELS OF SUBSURFACE STRUCTURAL GEOMETRIES, HOW SHORTENING TRANSFERS FROM LOWER TO UPPER CRUSTAL LEVELS, AND THE LONG-TERM INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FRONTAL THRUST STRUCTURES AND FORELAND-BASIN SEDIMENTATION.

FORENSIC SCIENCE IS A UNIQUE, INTERSECTIONAL FIELD THAT REQUIRES BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION IN MULTIPLE AREAS OF SCIENCES INCLUDING CRIMINAL JUSTICE. CLASSROOM-BASED TRAINING, ALONE, IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR ENTRY-LEVEL CAREERS, AS RESEARCH AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, IF PRESENT, DO NOT EQUATE TO A YEAR OF EXPERIENCE NEEDED TO BE HIRED. THIS PROJECT WILL FILL A CURRENT GAP OF PRACTITIONER-INVOLVED FORENSIC SCIENCE RESEARCH BY PROVIDING UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCHERS WITH REAL CASE EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO GRADUATION. TWELVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCHERS WILL BE EXPOSED TO COLD CASES, FORENSIC SCIENCE RELATED RESEARCH, CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE, AND ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS TO ENSURE THEY ARE WELL-PREPARED FOR FUTURE CAREERS OR GRADUATE SCHOOL, ULTIMATELY DIVERSIFYING THE FORENSIC SCIENCE WORKFORCE AND REDUCING EVIDENCE BACKLOG. EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE STUDENT SUCCESS AND RETENTION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCHERS, THE EXPANSION OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE STEM EDUCATION, THE IMPROVEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR STUDENTS WHEN ENTERING THE WORKFORCE, AND THE IMPACT OF OUTREACH ON ENROLLMENT TO STEM MAJORS. FOUNDATIONAL FORENSIC SCIENCE COURSEWORK WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR K-12 STUDENTS THAT WILL BE PROVIDED OPEN-SOURCE TO EDUCATORS, ALLOWING SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE TO INCORPORATE VETTED FORENSIC SCIENCE MATERIAL INTO THEIR CLASSROOMS.

WORKPLACE OSTRACISM OCCURS WHEN AN ORGANIZATIONAL MEMBER IS EXCLUDED OR IGNORED BY OTHER PEOPLE AT WORK. ALMOST 70% OF AMERICAN EMPLOYEES HAVE EXPERIENCED WORKPLACE OSTRACISM. THE SITUATION IS WORSE AMONG EMPLOYEES WITH A RACIAL MINORITY BACKGROUND, POSING A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE FOR ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS WHO STRIVE TO PROMOTE AN INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE IN AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW EMPLOYEES RESPOND EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY TO WORKPLACE OSTRACISM AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR RACIAL BACKGROUND AND COGNITIVE ATTRIBUTION AFFECT THIS PROCESS. FURTHERMORE, THE RESEARCHERS DETERMINE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF RELATIONSHIP CRAFTING, A PROACTIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAT HELPS OSTRACIZED EMPLOYEES TO REGAIN SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, RECOVER WELLBEING, AND RESTORE PERFORMANCE. FINDINGS OF THIS PROJECT HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE WORKPLACE. USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH, THIS PROJECT CONDUCTS THREE STUDIES. FIRST, USING A VIGNETTE-BASED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, THE INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE THE MAIN AND INTERACTION EFFECTS OF WORKPLACE OSTRACISM AND COGNITIVE ATTRIBUTIONS ON THE VICTIMS? EMOTIONAL STRAINS. SECOND, EMPLOYING A BATTERY OF LABORATORY TASKS (CYBERBALL GAME, GIFT CARD TASK, AND TRIER SOCIAL STRESS TEST) AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES (SKIN CONDUCTANCE LEVEL AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY), THE INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE THE DISTINCT ACTIVITIES OF SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE FUNCTION OF RELATIONSHIP CRAFTING AMONG OSTRACIZED INDIVIDUALS.

EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 10% OF PLANT SPECIES HAVE SEPARATE MALES AND FEMALES, THIS PLANT MATING SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED REPEATEDLY IN THE HISTORY OF GREEN PLANTS AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND ITS EVOLUTION. MOREOVER, MANY ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CROPS HAVE SEPARATE MALES AND FEMALES, AND OFTEN THE MALE OR THE FEMALE IS MORE VALUABLE THAN THE OTHER (E.G., FEMALE HOLLY, MALE GINGKO), AND THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BEFORE MATURITY. IN OTHER SITUATIONS, KEEPING MALES AND FEMALES SEPARATE AND STABLE (E.G., FEMALE CANNABIS, FEMALE HOPS) IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF A PRODUCT. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ASPECT OF PLANT BIOLOGY ECONOMICALLY WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THIS EXPRESSION IN PLANTS. THIS PROJECT WILL RESEARCH A SPECIAL GROUP OF PLANTS THAT EXHIBIT SEPARATE MALES AND FEMALES ? THOSE FOR WHICH THE ENVIRONMENT CONTROLS THE EXPRESSION OF MALE OR FEMALE FUNCTION. CHROMOSOMES THAT DETERMINE MALE OR FEMALE FLOWER TYPES ARE RARE IN PLANTS AND SPECIES WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT PLAYS A STRONG ROLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS EITHER MALE OR FEMALE FLOWERS, AND CHANGE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER, DURING THEIR LIVES.

THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC UNDERPINNINGS OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-BASED PLASTICITY IN FLORAL FUNCTION AND SEEKS ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. 1. ARE THERE DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT AND KIND OF GENE EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF FLORAL TYPE? 2. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE TRANSCRIPTOME CHANGE DURING FLORAL DEVELOPMENT? 3. HOW SIMILAR IS THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILE OF SPECIES WITH THIS PLASTICITY IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SPECIES? IS IT MORE SIMILAR TO THOSE EXHIBITING DIOECY OR MONOECY? THROUGH THIS WORK NEW UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GENE ACTIVATION AND ACTIVITY RESPONDS TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO SHAPE FLORAL PHENOTYPE WILL OBTAIN. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS BECOMING MORE CRITICAL WITH A CHANGING CLIMATE. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES LONG-HELD QUESTIONS ON THE EVOLUTION OF PLANT MATING SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL OF FLORAL PHENOTYPE IS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED AS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO DIOECY, NO STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED HOW TRANSCRIPTOMICALLY SIMILAR THESE SPECIES ARE TO THOSE WITH MONOECIOUS OR DIOECIOUS MATING SYSTEMS. THIS INHIBITS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROUTE TO DIOECY, A MAJOR AND REPEATED EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITION IN PLANTS.

IDENTIFYING RELIABLE PATTERNS OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEEMINGLY DISPARATE DOMAINS REMAINS A CORE CHALLENGE AT THE FOUNDATION OF DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. DOING THIS WHEN THE DOMAINS INVOLVED ARE EACH COMPLEX, HETEROGENEOUS, AND HAVE ENORMOUS DATASETS IS AN EVEN MORE ARDUOUS TASK. THE PROJECT IDENTIFIES A CLASS OF PROBLEMS INVOLVING LOOSELY-COUPLED HETEROGENEOUS DOMAINS, AND PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR PERFORMING LARGE-SCALE ASSOCIATION DISCOVERIES ACROSS SUCH COMPLEX DOMAINS. OUR FRAMEWORK IS BUILT ON A STRONG THEORETICAL FOUNDATION, NAMELY, THE INFORMATION BOTTLENECK ROOTED IN INFORMATION THEORY. THE PROJECT MAKES NEW THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FOUNDATION OF DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING BY DEVELOPING NEW METHODS FOR LEARNING HIDDEN ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS TWO HETEROGENEOUS DOMAINS, AND FOR INTEGRATING INFORMATION ACROSS SUCH DOMAINS. THE PROJECT ALSO DEVELOPS NOVEL APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW LEARNING METHODS TO TWO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND CROP PHENOMICS. THE PROPOSED METHOD OF DISCOVERING ASSOCIATION PATTERNS UNDER THE IDENTIFIED CLASS OF LOOSELY-COUPLE DOMAINS CAN EASILY BE MODIFIED FOR ANY MEMBER OF THIS IDENTIFIED CLASS.

WORKSHOP WILL EMPHASIZE THESE RHETORICAL PATTERNS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTORSHIP TO GAIN MASTERY OF THEM. FIRST, NSF CAREER AWARDS RELATED TO BIOMEDICAL OR BIOENGINEERING WILL BE DECONSTRUCTED BY A COMMUNICATIONS SCIENCE EXPERT. SECOND, THE IDENTIFIED COMMON RHETORICAL ELEMENTS WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR WORKSHOP MATERIALS AND PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE ACTIONABLE AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION. THIS PROPOSAL-WRITING WORKSHOP WILL COACH EARLY CAREER FACULTY TO BE BETTER PROPOSAL WRITERS BY IDENTIFYING THE LANGUAGE STRUCTURE THAT IS COMMON ACROSS SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS AND TEACHING THEM HOW TO APPLY THAT STRUCTURE TO THEIR OWN PROPOSALS. PARTICIPANTS, WITH PRIORITY GIVEN TO THOSE UNDERREPRESENTED IN ENGINEERING, WILL BE WELL POSITIONED TO SUBMIT COMPETITIVE CAREER PROPOSALS, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BROADENING PARTICIPATION. THIS WORKSHOP WILL ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO NSF CAREER PROPOSAL WRITING IN BIO- AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RHETORICAL PATTERNS. RHETORICAL PATTERNS IN SCIENTIFIC WRITING ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES. FOR INSTANCE, WOMEN ARE SOCIALIZED TO NOT BRAG, DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF USING RHETORICAL DEVICES TO ADD PROMOTIONAL VALUE TO ONE?S RESEARCH ARTICLES TO CONVINCE PEERS OF ITS VALUE. NOVICE AND NON-NATIVE ENGLISH TECHNICAL WRITERS CAN MAKE BETTER RHETORICAL CHOICES WHEN INFORMED OF RHETORICAL PATTERNS. RHETORICAL PATTERNS ARE WAYS OF ORGANIZING AND COMMUNICATING INFORMATION AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE CLEAR PRESENTATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. WHEN ENGLISH ADJECTIVES DEVIATE FROM THE ORDER ?OPINION-SIZE-AGE-SHAPE-COLOR-ORIGIN-MATERIAL-PURPOSE NOUN,? A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER WILL RECOGNIZE THAT THE SENTENCE IS ODD BUT WOULD LIKELY BE UNABLE TO ARTICULATE THIS LIST. SIMILARLY, EXPERIENCED PROPOSAL WRITERS AND REVIEWERS UNDERSTAND CORRECT RHETORICAL PATTERNS IN TECHNICAL WRITING WITHOUT NECESSARILY BEING ABLE TO IMPART IT TO EARLY CAREER INVESTIGATORS. JUST AS INCORRECT WORD ORDER REVEALS NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS, PROPOSAL WRITERS WHO DEVIATE FROM EXPECTED RHETORICAL PATTERNS ARE IDENTIFIED AS ?NON-NATIVE PROPOSAL WRITERS.? THE RHETORIC OF SCIENCE CONTENDS THAT THE PRACTICE OF SCIENCE IS PERSUASIVE?IN PROPOSAL WRITING, THE AUTHOR MUST CONVINCE REVIEWERS THAT THEIR RESEARCH IS BASED ON SOUND SCIENTIFIC METHOD OR ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES. THE RHETORICAL PATTERNS IN SUCH WRITING INVOLVE PATTERNS CALLED ?SITUATION-PROBLEM-SOLUTION-EVALUATION? THAT SHOWCASE THE RESEARCHER?S OBSERVATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL COMPETENCE WHILE DEMONSTRATING EXPLANATORY AND PREDICTIVE POWER. IF THESE RHETORICAL PATTERNS ARE NOT MASTERED, THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUNDING MAY BE AFFECTED DESPITE THE COMPETENCE OF THE RESEARCHER. TEACHING PROPOSAL-WRITING BY EMPLOYING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL USE OF RHETORICAL PATTERNS MAY LESSEN THE IMPACT OF SOCIOCULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN PROPOSAL REVIEW.

UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS AND DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING ARE IMPORTANT SKILLS FOR EVERYONE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS PURSUING CAREERS IN STEM FIELDS. HOWEVER, STUDENTS FREQUENTLY STRUGGLE WITH LEARNING HOW TO EFFECTIVELY READ, ANALYZE, AND WRITE ABOUT SCIENCE. MOREOVER, MANY STUDENTS LEAVE SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNCONNECTED AND UNINSPIRED BY TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS. AT THE SAME TIME, TEACHERS STRUGGLE TO FIND TEACHING RESOURCES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE TO ENGAGE THEIR STUDENTS IN THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES USING SUCCESSFUL INNOVATIVE METHODS SUCH AS HAVING STUDENTS PRACTICE SCIENCE WHILE WORKING IN TEAMS ON REAL PROBLEMS AND GENERATING READILY AVAILABLE TEACHING MATERIALS. TEAMS OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WILL CREATE ACCESSIBLE AND FREE LEARNING MATERIALS BASED ON POPULAR SCIENCE PODCASTS. THE PROJECT IS NOVEL BECAUSE IT WILL USE MODERN COMMUNICATION TOOLS TO ENGAGE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. THE IMPACT OF THESE TRAINING AND LEARNING MATERIALS ON STUDENT SCIENCE LITERACY, IDENTITY, AND MOTIVATION WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES FOR TRAINING FACULTY TO IMPLEMENT THESE MATERIALS IN THE CLASSROOM. A GUIDING IMPERATIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF A DIVERSE STEM WORKFORCE USING ACTIVE METHODS AND ACCESSIBLE MATERIALS THAT BUILD SCIENCE LITERACY AND CRITICAL THINKING. THROUGH THE CREATION OF OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES, WHICH ARE FREE, ADAPTABLE, OF HIGH QUALITY, AND ACCESSIBLE, THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON ENHANCING SCIENCE LITERACY AND CRITICAL THINKING. MOREOVER, THIS PROJECT STRIVES TO INCREASE INCLUSIVITY IN STEM EDUCATION GIVEN THAT PUBLICLY AND WIDELY AVAILABLE RESOURCES USUALLY ENGAGE LARGER, MORE DIVERSE POPULATIONS BY REMOVING ACCESSIBILITY BARRIERS.

IN DIMORPHIC FUNGI THE CELLULAR PRODUCTION OF POLYAMINES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL TRANSITION FROM YEAST TO FILAMENTOUS CELL TYPES, BUT THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS MEDIATING THIS TRANSITION ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR RELATIONSHIP OF INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINE POOLS AND FUNGAL DIMORPHISM USING C. ALBICANS AS THE MODEL ORGANISM. THE PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS CONFIRMED THE NECESSITY OF ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE AND S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE DECARBOXYLASE ENZYME ACTIVITIES FOR YEAST MORPHOGENESIS; THESE ENZYMES ARE ENCODED BY THE SPE1 AND SPE2 GENES, RESPECTIVELY. A REVERSE GENETICS APPROACH WILL BE USED TO FURTHER EXPLORE POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHESIS AND REGULATION IN THIS YEAST. USING A VARIETY OF MORPHOGENETIC ASSAYS, METABOLIC PROFILING, GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS, PROTEIN EXPRESSION ASSAYS, RNA-SEQ BASED TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING, AND COMPUTER-AIDED GENE ANNOTATIONS, THIS STUDY WILL CHARACTERIZE THE SPE1 AND SPE2 COREGULATORY FUNCTION IN C. ALBICANS MORPHOGENESIS AND DE NOVO POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHESIS. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY WILL UNCOVER THE POLYAMINE-INDUCED FILAMENTATION SIGNALING PATHWAYS THAT COULD BE HARNESSED TO IDENTIFY TARGETS OF CONTROL TO COMBAT THE INFECTIONS CAUSED BY THIS OPPORTUNISTIC PLANT AND HUMAN FUNGAL PATHOGEN. OVERALL, THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BRIDGE THE KNOWLEDGE GAP BETWEEN POLYAMINE METABOLISM AND FUNGAL PHYSIOLOGY.

IN AN EFFORT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ENGAGE MULTIPLE LEVERS OF CHANGE TO ACHIEVE EQUITABLE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND CULTURALLY VALIDATING ENVIRONMENTS FOR STUDENTS THAT REPRESENT THE FULL SPECTRUM OF DIVERSE TALENT AT HSIS, MANY HSIS RESPOND BY OFFERING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY ON CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND RELEVANT PEDAGOGIES. THESE WORTHWHILE LOCAL EFFORTS CAN BE ENHANCED BY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEVERAGING LIMITED RESOURCES. THIS PROJECT WILL OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO A DECENTRALIZED HSI INFORMATION LANDSCAPE BY CREATING A FREELY ACCESSIBLE WEB-BASED HSI-RESOURCE HUB FOR THE NATION?S GROWING NETWORK OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HSIS. THIS HSI RESOURCE HUB WILL BRING TOGETHER STEM FACULTY ACROSS THE HUNDREDS OF CURRENT AND EMERGING HSIS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PROJECT WILL CREATE A COMMUNITY OF STEM SCHOLARS WHO NOT ONLY ADOPT, BUT ALSO ADVANCE/CULTIVATE THEIR CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND RELEVANT PEDAGOGY.

AURORAS ARE A SPECTACULAR DISPLAY OF THE EFFECTS OF SUN'S ENERGETIC PARTICLES RAINING DOWN AND COLLIDING WITH EARTH?S ATMOSPHERE AT HIGH LATITUDES. THESE COLORFUL DISPLAYS ARE WIDELY OBSERVED TO HAVE SEVERAL TYPICAL SHAPES AND COLORS. RECENTLY, A ?NEW? TYPE OF AURORA-LIKE LIGHT AT HIGH LATITUDES HAS BEEN OBSERVED. IT OFTEN CONSISTS OF A NARROW PURPLE ARC WITH NARROW GREEN ?PICKET-FENCE? FEATURES. ITS DISTINCT SHAPES AND COLORS ARE DIFFERENT FROM TYPICAL AURORAS. SCIENTISTS NAMED IT AS STEVE (STRONG THERMAL EMISSION VELOCITY ENHANCEMENT). BECAUSE STEVE OCCURS AT LOWER LATITUDES THAN TYPICAL AURORAS (CALLED SUB-AURORAL REGION), IT IS BELIEVED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG FLOW OF CHARGED PARTICLES IN THE IONOSPHERE, A LAYER ABOVE OUR ATMOSPHERE WITH FREE-FLOWING IONS AND ELECTRONS. RESEARCH ON STEVE WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE HIGH AND LOW LATITUDE IONOSPHERE AND HOW SOLAR ENERGY IMPACTS THE ENTIRE EARTH?S ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM AND SPACE WEATHER. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTED, STEVE IS INTERPRETED TO BE DUE TO THE CHEMILUMINESCENT REACTIONS INDUCED BY HEAT GENERATED BY STRONG ION NEUTRAL INTERACTION AT LARGE ION DRIFT (~ 5000 M/S). TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS OF HEAT FROM STRONG ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTION CAUSING STEVE, BOTH ION DRIFT AND THERMOSPHERIC WIND OBSERVATIONS ARE NECESSARY. THE SWARM SATELLITES HAVE PROVIDED ION DRIFT DATA IN STEVE STUDIES, BUT OBSERVATIONS ARE MISSING FOR THE THERMOSPHERIC WIND AND TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS IN THE SUB-AURORAL REGION. TO OBTAIN THERMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE AND WIND OBSERVATIONS FOR ASCERTAINING THE STEVE EMISSION MECHANISM, THIS PROJECT WILL DEPLOY A FABRY PEROT INTERFEROMETER (FPI) AT ATHABASCA UNIVERSITY (54.60N, 113.64W, 61 MLAT), WHERE AN OPTICAL OBSERVATORY IS LOCATED AND STEVE HAD BEEN OBSERVED. IN ADDITION, A SMALL COLOR CCD ALL SKY CAMERA WILL BE USED TO MONITOR THE OCCURRENCE OF STEVE AND AURORAL ACTIVITIES AND A DUAL-BAND GPS RECEIVER WILL BE USED TO MONITOR IONOSPHERIC TOTAL ELECTRON CONTENT VARIATIONS. THE TEAM PLANS TO SPEND 20 NIGHTS/YEAR TO TAKE ALL SKY CAMERA IMAGES IN REAL TIME AND STEER THE FPI SKY SCANNER TOWARD THE STEVE WHEN IT IS SIGHTED. THE REAL TIME MONITORING IS PLANNED FOR SUBSTORM EVENTS FOLLOWING FUTURE SOLAR ACTIVE REGION EVENTS, WHICH WILL BE TRACKED FROM NOAA SPACE WEATHER SERVICES. THE AURORAL IMAGES AND FPI DATA WILL BE STUDIED IN COMBINATION WITH THE SWARM ION DRIFT DATA TO ACHIEVE A COMPARATIVELY COMPLETE DIAGNOSIS OF THE IONOSPHERE AND THERMOSPHERE CONDITIONS. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THREE TOPICS: 1) THERMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH STEVE AND THEIR EFFECT ON ITS EMISSION; 2) SAPS EFFECTS ON THERMOSPHERIC WINDS; 3) THERMOSPHERIC WIND'S EFFECT ON THE EXPANSION OF THE SUBSTORM NEGATIVE PHASE. GIVEN THE EXTREME IONOSPHERIC CONDITION ASSOCIATED WITH STEVE, LARGE THERMOSPHERIC WIND SPEED AND HIGH NEUTRAL TEMPERATURE COULD BE OBSERVED, WHICH CAN CHANGE OUR PERCEPTION OF THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE INTERACTIONS. THE PROPOSED ATHABASCA FPI CAN BRIDGE THE LARGE SPATIAL GAP BETWEEN THE RESOLUTE AND BOULDER FPI AND ALLOW THE SUBSTORM EFFECT FROM HIGH TO MID LATITUDES TO BE TRACKED. SINCE ATHABASCA IS LOCATED AT A LATITUDE RANGE THAT IS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE SUBSTORM NEGATIVE PHASE, THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR SPACE WEATHER FORECAST. SINCE STEVE WAS FIRST OBSERVED BY CITIZEN SCIENTISTS, THIS PROJECT WILL GENERATE A GREATER PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE AERONOMY RESEARCH AND WILL STIMULATE FUTURE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE PROJECT WILL FOSTER DIVERSE COLLABORATIONS AND ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NCAR AND A SCIENTIFICALLY COMPETITIVE INSTITUTION IN AN EPSCOR STATE.

WHILE THERE EXISTS A WEALTH OF STUDIES ON PYROCHLORES, THE INTRICACIES OF THIS SYSTEM LEAVE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT INTENTIONALLY MANIPULATING THE CHEMISTRY AND STRUCTURE FOR THE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITY. THE PYROCHLORE STRUCTURE IS INHERENTLY COMPLEX DUE TO TWO INTERPENETRATING SUBNETWORKS, AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES CAN BE DRIVEN BY SUBSTITUTION OR VACANCIES ON EITHER NETWORK. ADDITIONALLY, THE TRIANGULAR ARRANGEMENT OF CATIONS ON EACH SUBLATTICE LEADS TO STRUCTURAL AND BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS DUE TO GEOMETRICAL CONSTRAINTS. THE RESEARCH CARRIED OUT UNDER THIS CAREER AWARD BUILDS ON PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE DRIVERS OF STRUCTURAL DISTORTIONS IN PYROCHLORES.

THE ABILITY TO THINK CREATIVELY IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN STEM FIELDS, PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING, WHICH REQUIRES DESIGNING SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT OFTEN HAVE NO SINGLE OR CORRECT SOLUTION. THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS IDENTIFY CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS, SUCH AS PROBLEM SOLVING AND FLEXIBILITY, AS CORE COMPETENCIES FOR MODERN STEM EDUCATION. YET EDUCATORS ARE NOT CURRENTLY EQUIPPED WITH ADEQUATE TOOLS TO ASSESS CREATIVITY IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. TO EFFECTIVELY PREPARE THE STEM WORKFORCE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT EDUCATORS AND RESEARCHERS CAN USE TO IDENTIFY WHAT WORKS IN STEM EDUCATION TO FOSTER CREATIVITY. CURRENT CREATIVITY TESTS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR STEM EDUCATORS, INCLUDING (IN-PERSON) PAPER ADMINISTRATION AND, PERHAPS MOST PROBLEMATICALLY, MANUAL SCORING THAT REQUIRES TEACHERS TO COUNT AND CODE THOUSANDS OF RESPONSES?A LABOR-INTENSIVE AND OFTEN COSTLY PROCESS, PARTICULARLY FOR UNDER-RESOURCED SCHOOLS. IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION, THE AVAILABILITY OF CREATIVITY TESTS THAT MEASURE STUDENT ABILITY FAIRLY AND CONSISTENTLY, REGARDLESS OF RACE OR ETHNICITY, IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL FOR EQUITY OF OPPORTUNITY IN STEM EDUCATION. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO CREATE AN ONLINE PLATFORM FOR MEASURING CREATIVITY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN THAT EDUCATORS CAN USE TO CATER TO THE NEEDS OF ALL THEIR STUDENTS. THE TOOL WILL ALLOW EDUCATORS TO ADMINISTER A RANGE OF ENGINEERING CREATIVITY TASKS AND AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATE CREATIVITY SCORES.

TWO AIMS GUIDE THIS PROJECT. FIRST IS TO BUILD AN ONLINE PLATFORM FOR LARGE-SCALE ENGINEERING DESIGN ASSESSMENT ? VALIDATING ALL PLATFORM TASKS WITH UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING STUDENTS ? TO ALLOW TEACHERS AND RESEARCHERS TO EASILY ASSESS CREATIVITY, AUTOMATICALLY COMPUTE CREATIVITY METRICS, AND GENERATE CUSTOMIZABLE STUDENT REPORTS. SECOND IS TO APPLY THE PLATFORM IN AN UNDERGRADUATE DESIGN COURSE AT PENN STATE THAT INCLUDES A 3-WEEK CREATIVITY MODULE (WITH LESSONS AND EXERCISES ON CREATIVITY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN) TO OBTAIN VALUABLE PLATFORM USABILITY DATA FROM BOTH INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS, WHILE EVALUATING A PROMISING UNDERGRADUATE COURSE INTENDED TO PROMOTE CREATIVITY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN. THE TEAM WILL APPLY RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MODELING AND MACHINE LEARNING ? INCLUDING ACTIVE LEARNING OF DESIGN SKETCHES AND DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTIC MODELING OF TEXT-BASED RESPONSES TO CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING TASKS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS APPROACH WILL STREAMLINE EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CREATIVITY, RESULTING IN A USER-FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST STEM EDUCATORS IN THE CLASSROOM. THE NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING FOR CREATIVITY PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENT AND ACROSS DIFFERENT FIELDS (NOT ONLY ENGINEERING). THE PI TEAM WILL ALSO DESIGN ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT ARE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND MINIMALLY BIASED ? ESPECIALLY FOR THE GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE ? AND COLLABORATE WITH STEM EDUCATORS TO MAXIMIZE THE USABILITY OF THE PLATFORM IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. THE ONLINE PLATFORM AND COURSE MATERIALS WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, FACILITATING THE NATIONAL TRANSITION TO REMOTE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (ACCELERATED BY THE CURRENT PANDEMIC) BY PROVIDING ONLINE RESOURCES FOR STEM TEACHERS AND RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

DIVERSITY-FOCUSED INITIATIVES CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO THE FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOCIETY, BUT THEY MAY HAVE LIMITED SUCCESS IN IMPROVING THE INCLUSION OF MARGINALIZED MEMBERS WHO LACK A SENSE OF COMMUNITY OR FEEL THEIR VOICES ARE NOT HEARD. ONE WAY TO INSTIGATE CULTURAL CHANGE FROM THE GROUND UP IS TO DEVELOP AFFINITY GROUPS WHERE MEMBERS OF HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES CAN DEVELOP SUPPORT NETWORKS BASED ON COMMON EXPERIENCES AND IDENTITIES. SUCH AFFINITY GROUPS CAN GO BEYOND ?ONE-SHOT? SOCIAL EVENTS AT CONFERENCES TO BUILD LONG-LASTING COMMUNITIES AND CONNECTION. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A MECHANISM TO CO-CREATE AFFINITY GROUPS WITHIN ORNITHOLOGY THAT CAN SERVE TO SUPPORT MEMBERS OF HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES, AMPLIFY THEIR VOICES, AND EMPOWER THEM TO HELP CHANGE THE CULTURE OF ORNITHOLOGY. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THREE MAJOR US ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY, WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY, AND ASSOCIATION FOR FIELD ORNITHOLOGISTS) TO JOINTLY SUPPORT AND ELEVATE MARGINALIZED MEMBERS IN ORNITHOLOGY. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRANSFORM ORNITHOLOGY INTO AN INCLUSIVE DISCIPLINE THAT LEVERAGES THE TALENTS OF THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF LEARNERS, SCIENTISTS, AND PRACTITIONERS TO SOLVE URGENT PROBLEMS IN ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. A RECENT DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY REVEALED THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS FROM HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED GROUPS FEEL A WEAKER SENSE OF BELONGING, FEEL THAT THEIR VOICES ARE NOT HEARD, AND FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT VALUED. THESE COMPONENTS COMPRISE KEY ELEMENTS OF TRANSFORMATIVE RESILIENCE: A FRAMEWORK FOR NOT ONLY INCREASING THE PERSISTENCE OF INDIVIDUALS FROM MARGINALIZED GROUPS, BUT TO CREATE PATHS FOR INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DESIGN A PROCESS FOR CO-CREATING AFFINITY GROUPS?I.E., IDENTITY-BASED GROUPS CREATED BY AND FOR MEMBERS FROM HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES?THAT FACILITATE TRANSFORMATIVE RESILIENCE. THE CO-CREATION PROCESS ENGAGES MARGINALIZED MEMBERS TO IMAGINE AN ORNITHOLOGICAL COMMUNITY WHERE THEY BELONG AND ARE VALUED, AND THEN CREATES AFFINITY GROUPS BASED ON THOSE VISIONS THROUGH A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS WITH EMERGING LEADERS OF THE COMMUNITIES. THE PROJECT SETS UP VAST POTENTIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING ACTIVITIES THAT BROADENS SUPPORT TO HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING TARGETED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT, IMPROVED COMMUNICATION, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. THE PROJECT WILL HAVE FOUR OTHER CATEGORIES OF BROADER IMPACTS: (1) FOSTERING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AMONG THREE ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, AND MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIETIES; (2) PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND JUSTICE (DEIJ) FOR A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR AND SUMMER MULTICULTURAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARS; (3) DISSEMINATING FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT BEYOND ACADEMIA; AND (4) BROADENING THE DIVERSITY OF SCHOLARS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN DEIJ RESEARCH.

ALTHOUGH INCLUSION OF FEMALES IN RESEARCH HAS IMPROVED, SEX-BASED DATA ARE OFTEN NOT BEING ANALYZED USING RIGOROUS APPROACHES. OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF SABV-COMPLIANT STUDIES SHOWED THAT WHEN AUTHORS REPORT SEX-SPECIFIC EFFECTS, THEY TESTED STATISTICALLY FOR SUCH EFFECTS ONLY 29% OF THE TIME. INSTEAD, CLAIMS OF SEX-SPECIFIC FINDINGS TYPICALLY REST ON ASSERTION ALONE. OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS INDICATE CLEARLY THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SABV HAS NOT BEEN RIGOROUS AND THAT THE PROCESS OF PEER REVIEW OF SABV-COMPLIANT RESEARCH NEEDS TO IMPROVE. FALSE CLAIMS OF SEX DIFFERENCES CAN LEAD TO THE WASTING OF RESOURCES ON ?DIFFERENCES? THAT DO NOT EXIST, AND TO INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. SIMILARLY, FALSE CLAIMS OF NON-DIFFERENCES CAN LEAD TO MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL SEXES AND GENDERS.

TO ADDRESS THIS, THE INVESTIGATORS EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL WEARABLE COOLING DEVICES AND WILL OBTAIN PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WILL HELP ASSESS AND IMPROVE THE EFFICACY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND USABILITY OF THE DEVICES. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL ENGAGE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO EXAMINE THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COOLING DEVICES AND THE POTENTIAL NEEDS FOR POLICY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS TO FACILITATE THEIR WIDESPREAD AND EQUITABLE ADOPTION. THE PROPOSED WORK HELPS VALIDATE PAST DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD OF THERMOREGULATORY PHYSIOLOGY: BODY HEAT IS NOT LOST TO THE ENVIRONMENT EQUALLY FROM ALL BODY SURFACES. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN HEAT LOSS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO PREVENT OR TREAT HEAT STRESS IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH FEASIBLE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCESSIBLE. THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO DEVELOP A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR WEARABLE COOLING THAT IS READILY SCALABLE. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ALSO HELP ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATERIALS, THERMODYNAMICS, AND HEAT TRANSFER IN A FLEXIBLE COOLING DEVICE. PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY FROM ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROPOSED EFFORTS. THE RESEARCH PROJECT SHOULD SERVE AS AN ATTRACTIVE PLATFORM TO ENCOURAGE AND EXCITE K-12 STUDENTS TO PURSUE FURTHER EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, GIVEN ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN APPLICATIONS THAT CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT HUMAN LIVES, ESPECIALLY THOSE EMPLOYED IN EXPOSED OCCUPATIONS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE DESIGNS MODIFY AND IMPROVE A TEMPLATE DEVELOPED UNDER THIS PROJECT?S PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PRECURSOR (NSF1612824). THE SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION ADDRESSES HOW GROWTH IN STEM ABILITIES, COLLABORATION, AND COMMUNICATION MUTUALLY REINFORCE ADOLESCENT PERSONAL AND SOCIAL IDENTITY FORMATION. PARTICIPATING STUDENTS IN THE US WILL INTENTIONALLY REFLECT HETEROGENEOUS BACKGROUNDS. THE PROJECT ANALYSIS WILL FOCUS ON WHETHER CULTURAL AND NATIONAL CROSS-BOUNDARY COLLABORATION CAN STRENGTHEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNERS' PERSONAL IDENTITY AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE PROJECT METHODOLOGY RELIES HEAVILY ON QUANTITATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY AND EPISTEMIC NETWORK ANALYSIS. THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE CREATION OF VISUAL MODELS THAT HIGHLIGHT THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CONSTRUCTS RELEVANT TO EACH RESEARCH QUESTION, ALONG WITH CHANGES BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUPS. THE CONSTRUCTS INCLUDE VARIATIONS OF AUTONOMY, COMPETENCE, AND CONNECTION (PILLARS OF SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY) IN TRACING IDENTITY FORMATION AND STEM ABILITIES. THE QUANTITATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY APPROACH PROVIDES STATISTICALLY RELIABLE SCAFFOLDING AND INSIGHTS ABOUT THE HUB DESIGNS AND THEIR EFFICACY IN PROMOTING GOALS OF BROADENING PARTICIPATION AND FOSTERING MUTUALLY REINFORCING STEM COMPETENCIES AND IDENTITY FORMATION. THIS TYPE OF VIRTUAL COLLABORATION, CROSSING BOUNDARIES OF CULTURE, NATIONALITY, ETHNICITY, AGE, GENDER, ECONOMIC STRATA, OR ABILITY, CAN REALISTICALLY BE EXPECTED TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN NEXT-GENERATION LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUT-OF-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.

FLIGHT IS A KEY ADAPTATION OF INSECTS, ENABLING THEIR CAPACITIES TO MIGRATE AND POLLINATE, AND THUS IS CRITICAL TO THE ROLES OF INSECTS BOTH AS BENEFICIAL ANIMALS AND PESTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY REMAINING UNKNOWNS ABOUT INSECT FLIGHT, LIMITING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF FLIGHT, HOW ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT FLYING INSECTS, AND HOW TO MANAGE FLYING INSECT PESTS. ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT INSECT FLIGHT REQUIRES AN INTEGRATION OF MOLECULAR, BIOCHEMICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND BIOMECHANICAL PERSPECTIVES. THE AWARD ADDRESSES THESE NEEDS BY BRINGING TOGETHER SCIENTISTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND CHARACTERISTICS, AND FROM A RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL SUBDISCIPLINES INCLUDING MOLECULAR EVOLUTION, BIOMECHANICS AND PHYSIOLOGY, AS SYMPOSIUM SPEAKERS. IN ADDITION, A WORKSHOP, ELEVEN PUBLICATIONS, AND COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE BEING SUPPORTED. TRAVEL AWARDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR TRAINEES IN THE COMPLEMENTARY SESSIONS, AND A NETWORK THAT WILL ALLOW FOR STUDENT TRAINING EXCHANGES WILL BE CREATED. A DATABASE AND EMAIL LISTSERV WILL BE CREATED TO CONNECT RESEARCHERS ACROSS FIELDS, TRAINING LEVELS, AND INSTITUTIONS. PROMOTION OF A DIVERSE SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE WILL OCCUR AS TRAINEES WILL BE INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION, AND COMMUNITY BUILDING FOR THE SYMPOSIUM. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES WILL BE ENHANCED BY FEATURING RESEARCH FROM GROUPS HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM SCIENCE. THE UNPARALLELED DIVERSITY OF INSECTS IS OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE EVOLUTION OF POWERED FLIGHT IN THE PTERYGOTE (WINGED) INSECT LINEAGE AROUND 400 MILLION YEARS AGO, PROVIDING BENEFITS OF DISPERSAL FROM INHOSPITABLE SITES, MATE FINDING, RESOURCE ACQUISITION, AND ESCAPE FROM PREDATORS. DESPITE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF FLIGHT TO INSECTS, MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN, INCLUDING AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INSECTS EVOLVED FLIGHT, HOW GENETIC DIFFERENCES TRANSLATE TO FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN FLIGHT MORPHOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND BEHAVIOR, AND HOW CLADE-SPECIFIC VARIANTS IN FLIGHT MORPHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY ARE RELATED TO ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. IN TERMS OF PHYSIOLOGY, MANY AREAS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD, INCLUDING HOW INSECTS MANAGE THE COSTS OF MIGRATION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIFE HISTORY AND FLIGHT MUSCLE PLASTICITY, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLIGHT MECHANICS AND FLIGHT MUSCLE COST. IN TERMS OF BIOMECHANICS, A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INSECTS STEER AND FLY IN COMPLEX, TURBULENT ENVIRONMENTS, THE NEUROSENSORY AND AERODYNAMIC MECHANISMS OF FLIGHT, AND THE LOCATION AND DYNAMICS OF ENERGY STORAGE ARE LACKING. THE SUPPORTED SYMPOSIUM WILL BRING TOGETHER RESEARCHERS WORKING ON THE EVOLUTION, ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND BIOMECHANICS OF FLIGHT TO STIMULATE INTEGRATION OF THESE FIELDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW AND WHY FLIGHT AROSE AND IS MAINTAINED IN INSECTS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER RESEARCHERS, INCLUDING EARLY-CAREER INVESTIGATORS, FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES WHO SHARE AN INTEREST IN INSECT FLIGHT, AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY WILL BE BUILT THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES AND GENERATE NEW RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY.

FOR EVERY BATTERY THAT IS DEVELOPED, MAXIMIZING THE MOTION OF CERTAIN TARGET IONS AND ENSURING A HIGH DEGREE OF USER SAFETY ARE TWO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT GOALS. IN THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL EXAMINE THE ABILITY OF A CLASS OF HIGHLY STABLE POLYMERS FEATURING ZWITTERIONIC SIDE GROUPS TO PROMOTE INCREASED SELECTIVE TRANSPORT OF SODIUM AND LITHIUM CATIONS. ZWITTERIONS ARE A CLASS OF MOLECULES WHICH CONTAIN BOTH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE CHARGE. MODERATE AMOUNTS OF A NONFLAMMABLE, ROOM TEMPERATURE MOLTEN SALT (AN IONIC LIQUID) WILL BE CO-FORMULATED IN THESE ELECTROLYTES TO ENHANCE OVERALL IONIC MOTION WHILE MAINTAINING SAFE OPERATION.

THIS IS AN UNDEREXPLORED COMPOSITIONAL SPACE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL POLYMER ELECTROLYTES AND IL-RICH IONOGELS. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PURSUING MULTIPLE SYNTHETIC STRATEGIES TO PREPARE SUCH ELECTROLYTES, PROBING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS CHARGED SPECIES USING SEVERAL MULTINUCLEAR NMR AND FTIR/RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES, MEASURING TOTAL IONIC CONDUCTIVITIES AND ALKALI METAL CATION TRANSFERENCE NUMBER VALUES VIA AC IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND DC POLARIZATION TESTS, AND INTERROGATING ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY UPON REPEATED STRIP-PLATE CYCLING IN SYMMETRIC ALKALI METAL ELECTRODE CELLS. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT HIGH-MOBILITY PATHWAYS FOR ALKALI METAL CATION TRANSPORT MAY BE CREATED ALONG THE PENDANT ZWITTERIONIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ON THE POLYMER, WHICH PROVIDES A MOTIVATION FOR EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF REDUCING THE IL CONTENT AMONG THIS NOVEL CLASS OF ELECTROLYTES. THIS PROJECT WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST TO DIRECTLY COMPARE SODIUM VERSUS LITHIUM CATION TRANSPORT USING DIFFERENT ZWITTERIONIC POLYMER CHEMISTRIES, WHICH WILL PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR THE FUTURE DESIGN OF POLYMER-BASED ELECTROLYTES FOR ?BEYOND-LI ION?

TRADITIONAL INTERESTS IN PROVISION OF WOOD PRODUCTS AND CLEAN WATER HAVE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CLIMATE MITIGATION, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL RESILIENCE. FORESTS ARE COMPLEX ECOSYSTEMS, DOMINATED BY LONG-LIVED ORGANISMS, AND ARE HIGHLY CONNECTED TO ADJACENT ECOSYSTEMS AT MANY SCALES. LONG-TERM RESEARCH AT THE HUBBARD BROOK EXPERIMENTAL FOREST HAS FOCUSED ON THE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF HARDWOOD FORESTS, WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF DISTURBANCE IN HOW FOREST ECOSYSTEMS WORK. THE RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY EVOLVED AS UNEXPECTED OBSERVATIONS EMERGE FROM LONG-TERM STUDIES, RAISING QUESTIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED WITH CONTINUED LONG-TERM RESEARCH. RECENT SURPRISES THAT WILL BE EXPLORED IN THIS LATEST PHASE OF RESEARCH ARE: 1) UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN THE ELEVATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOME TREE SPECIES THAT HAVE SURPRISINGLY MIGRATED DOWNWARD INSTEAD OF UP-SLOPE AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN RESPONSE TO WARMING TEMPERATURES; (2) ABRUPT INCREASES IN WATER USE BY PLANTS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, AND (3) SIGNIFICANT DECLINES SINCE THE 1970S IN SOME SPECIES OF BIRDS, SALAMANDERS, CATERPILLARS, AND BEETLES. THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF STUDIES AT HUBBARD BROOK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO BUILD DEEP RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE ALSO EVOLVING, AND RESEARCHERS WILL DIVERSIFY THEM TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. SPECIFICALLY, THEY WILL MAKE THE LENS OF RESEARCH MORE INCLUSIVE AND MORE HOLISTIC AND WILL RECRUIT NEW PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE THE SITE AND COMMUNITY MORE DIVERSE. THE OVERARCHING RESEARCH THEME OF THIS PROJECT IS THE LONG-TERM RESPONSE OF ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND FUNCTION TO DISTURBANCE. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL UNDERPINNING THE PROJECT ENVISIONS THREE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF DISTURBANCE ACTING AS DRIVERS OF CHANGE IN THE ECOSYSTEM: CHANGING ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY, CHANGING CLIMATE, AND CHANGING BIOTA. THE EFFECTS OF THESE DRIVERS PLAY OUT ON A BIOGEOPHYSICAL TEMPLATE THAT INCLUDES VARIATION ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN TOPOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY, SOILS, VEGETATION, AND HISTORY OF PAST DISTURBANCE. WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM, THE DISTURBANCES AFFECT THE INTERACTING PROCESSES OF HYDROLOGY, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, VEGETATION, AND FOOD WEB DYNAMICS. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL IS EVOLVING TO FOCUS ON ?CONTROL POINTS OF CHANGE? IN THE LANDSCAPE - SPECIFIC PLACES AND TIMES WHERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BEGIN OR ACCELERATE. THE RESEARCH IS INTEGRATED WITH BROADER IMPACTS ACTIVITIES DRIVEN BY FOUR GOALS: (1) ESTABLISH LONG-TERM, TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION-MAKERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN FOREST ECOREGION; (2) RECRUIT AND TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF ECOSYSTEM SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS; (3) SUPPORT DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ANTI-RACISM (DEI&A) WITHIN THE SITE AND BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES; AND (4) DRIVE INNOVATIONS IN RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, FIVE APPROACHES ARE PLANNED: PUBLIC AND POLICY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS, SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS, AN ART-SCIENCE PROGRAM, DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DEI&A, AND USE OF A CRITICAL ECOLOGY APPROACH TO MAKE THE LENS OF THE SITE?S RESEARCH MORE INCLUSIVE AND HOLISTIC.

YET THEY ALSO PRESENT SIGNIFICANT SAFETY, USER PRIVACY, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PLANNING CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY ?INCLUDING COMPUTER AND DATA SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND URBAN PLANNERS? HAS STARTED RESPONDING TO THESE CHALLENGES, BUT THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN AD HOC AND SLOW. THIS CAN BE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A LACK OF MICROMOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COLLECTING DIVERSE RIDER, MOBILITY, AND CONTEXTUAL DATA IN REALISTIC SETTINGS AND ENVIRONMENTS. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR A LARGE-SCALE AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE RESEARCH INSTRUMENT TO ENABLE SUCH DATA COLLECTION. TO THIS END, THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP, DEPLOY, AND MANAGE SCOOTERLAB, A COMMUNITY RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE COMPRISING A HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE FLEET OF MICROMOBILITY VEHICLES.

THESE MATERIALS ARE HIGHLY REACTIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND INTERACT WITH ELEMENTS AVAILABLE IN SOIL AND WATER, AFFECTING THEIR BIOAVAILABILITY FOR PLANTS AND MICROORGANISMS. THE SMALL SIZE OF METAL-BASED NANOMATERIALS RESULTS IN A HIGH RATE OF THEIR UPTAKE BY LIVING ORGANISMS INCLUDING PLANTS. THE IMPACT OF NANOMATERIALS ON LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR TOXICITY LEVEL DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THEIR SIZE, CONCENTRATION, AND TYPE, AS WELL AS THE EXPOSED ORGANISM. STUDIES ON THE FATE OF NANOMATERIALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE REPORTED THE POTENTIAL OF PLANTS TO ACCUMULATE NANOMATERIALS. HOWEVER, THE EXACT MECHANISM OF NANOMATERIALS UPTAKE AND THEIR FATE IN PLANTS IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. NANOMATERIALS ACCUMULATED IN PLANTS CAN ENTER THE HUMAN BODY THROUGH DIRECT CONSUMPTION OF PLANTS OR THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH PLANTS TO FURTHER PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND IMPROVE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE FATE OF THE COMMONLY USED METAL-BASED NANOMATERIAL, SILVER NANOPARTICLES, IN PLANTS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH ESSENTIAL PLANT NUTRIENTS SUCH AS POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND ZINC. THIS WILL INVOLVE A SERIES OF MOLECULAR, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND ANALYTICAL STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE FORM AND THE SITE OF ACCUMULATION OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES IN PLANTS, IN ADDITION TO THEIR IMPACT ON MEMBRANE TRANSPORTERS. THE PI WILL MENTOR UNDERGRADUATE AND MASTER?S STUDENTS DURING THE STUDY AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN STEM FIELDS INCLUDING WOMEN, FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. TO IMPROVE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT NANOMATERIALS AND THEIR FATE IN PLANTS, A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL WILL BE CREATED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY AND WILL BE DISPLAYED IN A LOCAL SCIENCE MUSEUM. NANOMATERIALS ARE USED WORLDWIDE IN VARIOUS SECTORS INCLUDING MEDICINE, AGRICULTURE, AND INDUSTRY. SILVER NANOPARTICLES ARE A COMMON FORM OF METAL-BASED NANOMATERIALS. THESE MATERIALS CAN BE OXIDIZED IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE IONIC FORM, WHICH IS MORE INTERACTIVE AND TOXIC THAN THE PARTICULATE FORM. SILVER NANOPARTICLES, IN EITHER PARTICULATE OR IONIC FORM, IMPACT PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND METABOLISM AT VARIOUS LEVELS INCLUDING THE MEMBRANE TRANSPORTERS AND ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY AFFECTS PLANT WATER ABSORPTION AND NUTRIENT TRANSLOCATION. SILVER NANOPARTICLES ARE NOT NEEDED FOR PLANT GROWTH AND THERE IS NOT A MEMBRANE TRANSPORTER SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR SILVER NANOPARTICLES TO ENTER CELLS. HOWEVER, SINCE PLANTS CAN TRANSLOCATE AND ACCUMULATE THESE NANOPARTICLES IN THEIR TISSUES, THERE MUST BE A TRANSPORTER THAT ALLOWS THESE MATERIALS TO PASS ACROSS THE MEMBRANE. PLASMA MEMBRANE AQUAPORIN AND POTASSIUM CHANNELS ARE AMONG THE POSSIBLE TRANSPORTERS FOR SILVER NANOPARTICLES. ONCE THESE NANOPARTICLES ARE TAKEN UP BY PLANTS, THEIR PRESENCE IN INTER- AND INTRA- CELLULAR SPACES CHANGES THE ELECTROCHEMICAL POTENTIAL OF CELLS. TO PROVIDE EQUILIBRIUM, THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL MEMBRANE TRANSPORTERS INCLUDING PROTON ATPASE, AND CATION AND ANION CHANNELS CAN BE IMPACTED. THIS IN TURN AFFECTS THE MOVEMENT OF ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS AND WATER ACROSS THE MEMBRANE, TURGOR PRESSURE, AND CYTOSOLIC AND APOPLASTIC PH LEVEL. THESE SERIES OF EVENTS CAN IMPACT THE STRUCTURE OF XYLEM CELLS AND SUBSEQUENTLY BIOACCUMULATION AND TRANSLOCATION OF ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS AND WATER IN PLANTS. DUE TO THE ROLE OF AQUAPORINS IN THE TRANSLOCATION OF WATER, MAINTAINING TURGOR PRESSURE, AND POTENTIALLY TRANSPORTING SILVER NANOPARTICLES ACROSS THE MEMBRANE, IN THIS STUDY TOMATO (LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM) AND MUTANT FOR AQUAPORIN PIP1 WILL BE EXPOSED TO SILVER NANOPARTICLES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISM OF TRANSLOCATION OF THESE NANOPARTICLES IN PLANTS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH PLANT ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE A SERIES OF ANALYTICAL, MOLECULAR, AND MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSES TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, INCLUDING THE CONCENTRATION, FORM, AND SITE OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES ACCUMULATION IN PLANTS, THE EFFECTS OF THEIR EXPOSURE ON MEMBRANE TRANSPORTERS, AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR EXPOSURE ON VASCULAR TISSUES.

THESE MICROORGANISMS USE INORGANIC NITROGEN (N) FROM THE WATER TO MAKE A VARIETY OF AMINO ACIDS. SOME OF THE AMINO ACIDS KEEP THE INITIAL CHEMICAL SIGNATURE (I.E., N ISOTOPE VALUE) OF THEIR N SOURCE. OTHER AMINO ACIDS ARE INVOLVED IN METABOLIC PROCESSES THAT CHANGE THE INITIAL CHEMICAL SIGNATURE (N ISOTOPE VALUE). THESE DISTINCT N ISOTOPE SIGNATURES ARE PASSED ALONG TO ORGANISMS THAT CONSUME PHYTOPLANKTON AND THROUGHOUT THE FOOD WEB. THUS, THE N ISOTOPE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL AMINO ACIDS CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN THE ISOTOPE VALUE OF N SOURCES SUPPORTING FOOD WEBS AND TO ESTIMATE THE TROPHIC POSITION OF ORGANISMS IN BIOTA, PARTICLES, CORAL SKELETONS, AND SEDIMENTS. BUT, THIS REQUIRES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE N ISOTOPE PATTERNS OF AMINO ACIDS PRODUCED BY PHYTOPLANKTON. THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE WHETHER DIFFERENT PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES PRODUCE AMINO ACIDS WITH DISTINCT N ISOTOPE PATTERNS WHEN USING THE SAME N SOURCE. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO STUDY WHETHER THE N ISOTOPE PATTERNS PRODUCED BY THE SAME SPECIES OF PHYTOPLANKTON CHANGE UNDER DIFFERENT GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. INFORMATION FROM THIS STUDY WILL IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO USE N ISOTOPE VALUES IN AMINO ACIDS IN ECOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL STUDIES.

THE USE OF N ISOTOPE VALUES OF DIFFERENT AMINO ACIDS (?15N-AA) TO RETRIEVE THE N SOURCE ISOTOPE SIGNATURE OF FOOD WEBS AND ESTIMATE TROPHIC POSITIONS DEPENDS ON INFORMATION ABOUT THE ?15N-AA PRODUCED BY PHYTOPLANKTON AT THE BASE OF THE FOOD WEB WHICH IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO EXPLORE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ?15N-AA PRODUCED BY PHYTOPLANKTON. 1) UNDER THE SAME NITROGENOUS NUTRIENT AND GROWTH CONDITIONS, DO ?15N-AA PATTERNS VARY BETWEEN MAJOR PHYTOPLANKTON GROUPS? ARE THE UNIQUE ?15N-AA PATTERNS IN DIATOMS RELATED TO UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THEIR N METABOLISM? 2) DO CHANGES IN PHYTOPLANKTON PHYSIOLOGY RESULTING FROM NITROGENOUS NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, N FORM UTILIZED (AMMONIUM, NITRATE, AND MIXED), AND/OR OTHER GROWTH CONDITIONS INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ?15N-AA? PHYTOPLANKTON SAMPLES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM CONTROLLED CULTURE (E.G., CHEMOSTAT) EXPERIMENTS AND FROM FIELD STUDIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND CHESAPEAKE BAY, ESPECIALLY DURING NEAR-MONOSPECIFIC BLOOM EVENTS. BY TAKING THE ADVANTAGE OF NEWLY DEVELOPED ANALYTICAL APPROACHES, NEW KNOWLEDGE OF COMPOUND AND INTRAMOLECULAR ?15N OF POLY-N AA SUCH AS ARGININE, ASPARAGINE, GLUTAMINE, AND HISTIDINE IN PHYTOPLANKTON WILL BE GENERATED FOR THE FIRST TIME.

THE DEVOLUTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OVER NATURAL RESOURCES IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR POLICY RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING NATIONS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS TREND IS THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOW COLLECTIVELY OWN AND MANAGE AN INCREASING SHARE (CURRENTLY MORE THAN 15 PERCENT) OF THE WORLD'S REMAINING FORESTS. SEVERAL SCHOLARS HAVE REPORTED THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT OWN AND MANAGE THEIR FORESTS COLLECTIVELY OFTEN PERFORM BETTER THAN GOVERNMENTS, AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. SOME SCHOLARS, HOWEVER, ARE VOICING CONCERNS THAT WHEN LOCAL RESOURCE USERS SELF-GOVERN SHARED RESOURCES IT OFTEN PRODUCES INCREASED INEQUALITY: THE RISK THAT THE MANAGEMENT ENDS UP BENEFITING MOSTLY THE RELATIVELY RICH OR PRIVILEGED MEMBERS OF NATURAL RESOURCE USER GROUPS, HENCE FURTHER MARGINALIZING POORER MEMBERS. THIS RISK IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACHES, ESPECIALLY AS THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT COMMON-POOL RESOURCES USED BY GROUPS WITH RELATIVELY HIGH DEGREES OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY TEND TO HAVE MORE DEGRADED RESOURCE CONDITIONS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH COMMUNITY-BASED GOVERNANCE APPROACHES PRODUCE SUCH INEQUALITIES, AND THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT RESOURCE USERS MAY DESIGN AND ENFORCE TO FOSTER MORE EQUITABLE GOVERNANCE OUTCOMES. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES TWO TYPES OF DECISION MAKING IN NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE PROCESSES. FIRST, THE RESEARCH PRODUCES A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNANCE INEQUALITIES AFFECT THE DECISIONS OF DISADVANTAGED HOUSEHOLDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GROUP'S GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS OF THOSE DECISIONS ON RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY. SECOND, BY EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ON WHO BENEFITS FROM RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THE RESEARCH PRODUCES NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INEQUALITY IN FOREST USER GROUPS. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCHERS EXAMINE COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT GROUPS IN NEPAL AND INDIA AND FOCUS ON THREE QUESTIONS: HOW DO INEQUALITIES INFLUENCE COLLECTIVE ACTION? HOW DOES INEQUALITY INFLUENCE THE DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS AND SUSTAINABILITY? WHAT INTERVENTIONS REDUCE INEQUALITY? THE FOUR HYPOTHESES ARE: INTERVENTIONS TO DECREASE INEQUALITY DE FACTO CAN INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING; WILL MOTIVATE GREATER TIME INVESTMENTS IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WILL INCREASE BENEFITS OF THE COMMONS GOING TO DISADVANTAGED HOUSEHOLDS, AND WILL ACHIEVE IMPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES. THE TEAM EVALUATES THE HYPOTHESES THROUGH FOUR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EACH OF WHICH USES THREE INEQUALITY REDUCING INTERVENTIONS. THE VILLAGES ARE SELECTED USING MATCHED-PAIR CLUSTER-RANDOMIZATION WITH AN N OF 360 VILLAGES WHICH MAKES FOR 60 VILLAGES PER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION PER COUNTRY. THERE IS ALSO AN ETHNOGRAPHIC CASE STUDY IN EIGHT VILLAGES. THE INTERVENTIONS ARE: CREATION OF A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR LOW-CASTE AND TRIBAL GROUPS, A SUBCOMMITTEE PLUS TRAINING FOR HIGH-CASTE AND MALE CITIZENS ON THE VALUE OF INCLUSIVENESS, AND BOTH OF THESE PLUS A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR WOMEN.

ADVANCED COMPUTING RESOURCES HAVE INCREASINGLY BECOME A CRITICAL PRODUCTION FACTOR FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. HOWEVER, THE UTILIZATION OF SUCH ADVANCED COMPUTING RESOURCES TENDS TO GIVE ADVANTAGES TO WELL-RESOURCED INSTITUTIONS AND WIDEN THE EQUITY GAP BETWEEN THESE INSTITUTIONS AND MINORITY OR OTHER UNDER-RESOURCED INSTITUTIONS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE DATA-ENABLED PATHWAYS TO ADVANCE EQUITY IN THE UTILIZATION OF ADVANCED COMPUTING RESOURCES. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL, THE RESEARCH TEAM IMPLEMENTS THREE INTERCONNECTED TASKS: (A) UNDERSTANDING AND DEFINING EQUITY FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' PERSPECTIVES, (B) STUDYING AND DESIGNING PATHWAYS TO EQUITY IN UTILIZATION, AND (C) DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A KNOWLEDGE PORTAL FEATURING AN INTERACTIVE DATA PLATFORM TO SUPPORT THESE PATHWAYS TO MORE EQUITABLE UTILIZATION. THESE PATHWAYS UNLOCK THE TALENTS AND INSIGHTS OF THE RESEARCHERS IN UNDERSERVED INSTITUTIONS AND FIELDS OF SCIENCE FOR ADVANCING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AND ELEVATING NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. THIS RESEARCH STUDIES AND PROVIDES DATA-ENABLED PATHWAYS TO EQUITY IN PUBLICLY-SUPPORTED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZATION FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATES HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PEOPLE, AND SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED BUT OPERATIONALLY INTEGRATED ADVANCED COMPUTING SERVICES TO RESEARCHERS. EQUITY IS A CORE PUBLIC VALUE BUT A CONCERN FOR UTILIZING CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE THAT FAVORS HIGH-CAPACITY RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS. THE NSF?S CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS SERVE AS AN EMPIRICAL FOCAL POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING EQUITY DUE TO THEIR SCALE, DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS, AND IMPACTS ON SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. THIS PROJECT TEAM ASSEMBLES A DATABASE OF NSF CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZATION FOR 25,798 PROJECTS, ENCOMPASSING 10,277 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS, 1,044 ORGANIZATIONS, AND 215 SCIENCE FIELDS FROM 2003 TO 2022. THIS RESEARCH ADOPTS A MIXED-METHODS EXPLORATORY SEQUENTIAL DESIGN BY GATHERING, ANALYZING, AND INTEGRATING DATA FROM (A) COMBINING THE INTERACTIVE DATA PLATFORM WITH A STAKEHOLDER-FOCUSED QUALITATIVE INTERPRETIVE PROCESS AND (B) ANALYZING A SOCIO-TECHNICAL NETWORKED SYSTEM BY CONSIDERING LEVELS AND DYNAMICS OF CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVITIES.

THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE 1) TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR STRATEGIC RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF FACULTY ACROSS GENDER, RACE, AND INTERNATIONAL STATUS BY IDENTIFYING BARRIERS AND STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS THAT IMPACT STEM DIVERSITY, AND 2) TO SET THE STAGE FOR INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION BEYOND THE GRANT PERIOD TO REDUCE INEQUITIES THAT HINDER THESE GROUPS OF FACULTY DURING AND OUTSIDE OF A GLOBAL CRISIS. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL EXAMINE INSTITUTIONAL DATA, AND CONDUCT SURVEYS AND IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ASSESSMENT AIM TO HELP RESHAPE POLICIES THAT WILL SUPPORT RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT OF DIVERSE FACULTY. THE DATA ACQUIRED IN THIS STUDY WILL BE REPORTED USING MULTI-MEDIA METHODS, INCLUDING TECHNICAL PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES; CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS; AND AN ESTEAM WEBSITE. STEM FACULTY AT MIAMI WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED IN TWO PROGRAMS INITIATED BY THIS PROJECT: 1) AN ESTEAM FACULTY LEARNING COMMUNITY THAT WILL REVIEW AND DISCUSS LITERATURE ON EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION, IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL RECRUITING, RETENTION, AND PROMOTION OF DIVERSE FACULTY, AND DEVELOP ESTEAM PRESENTATION MODULES ON STEM-DIVERSITY THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH ADMINISTRATORS, FACULTY, AND STUDENTS; AND 2) A ?STEM-EQUITY? MENTORING PROGRAM, WHICH WILL AIM TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE FOR ALL STEM FACULTY. RESULTS FROM THIS MENTORSHIP APPROACH WILL BE DOCUMENTED AND DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY?S ESTEAM WEBSITE AND THROUGH SCHOLARLY WORK. THE NSF ADVANCE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO FOSTER GENDER EQUITY THROUGH A FOCUS ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND ELIMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE THE FULL PARTICIPATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF DIVERSE FACULTY IN ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. ORGANIZATIONAL BARRIERS THAT INHIBIT EQUITY MAY EXIST IN POLICIES, PROCESSES, PRACTICES, AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND CLIMATE.

SALISH KOOTENAI COLLEGE AND BLACKFEET COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE BOTH TRIBAL COLLEGES. OVER ITS SIX-YEAR DURATION, THIS PROJECT WILL FUND SCHOLARSHIPS TO 105 UNIQUE FULL-TIME STEM STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING ASSOCIATE AND/OR BACHELOR DEGREES IN BIOLOGICAL AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, PHYSICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES, AND/OR NATURAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION. FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS IN BACHELOR DEGREE PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE FOUR-YEAR SCHOLARSHIPS WHILE TRANSFER STUDENTS AND FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS IN ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE TWO-YEAR SCHOLARSHIPS. STUDENTS IN THE PROJECT WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF SUPPORTS SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL MENTORING FROM STEM FACULTY MEMBERS AND PEERS AND MONTHLY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH STUDENTS FROM ALL FOUR INSTITUTIONS. ONE OF THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM IS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN FOUR INSTITUTIONS. THIS INCREASED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND TRIBAL COLLEGES WILL FACILITATE A BIDIRECTIONAL SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES FOR MENTORING, INCLUSIVE INSTRUCTION, AND STUDENT SUPPORT. THE PARTNERSHIP WILL ALSO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO PEERS AND FACULTY MEMBERS AT THREE OTHER INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE STEM DEGREE COMPLETION OF LOW-INCOME, HIGH-ACHIEVING UNDERGRADUATES WITH DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED. THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO INCREASE THE FIRST-YEAR RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES FOR EACH STUDENT COHORT, IMPROVE TRANSITION AFTER GRADUATION TO EITHER A STEM CAREER OR FURTHER HIGHER EDUCATION, AND ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ISSUES AND FACTORS IMPACTING ADVANCEMENT ALONG THE ACADEMIC PATHWAY. MONTANA FACES POST-SECONDARY PERSISTENCE CHALLENGES WITH TWO OF ITS LARGEST POPULATION GROUPS: NATIVE AMERICANS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM EXTREMELY RURAL AREAS. EACH GROUP FACES UNIQUE PERSISTENCE CHALLENGES, WITH SOME COMMONALITIES (E.G., STRONG TIES TO FAMILY/LAND, CULTURE SHOCK, STEREOTYPES). STUDENTS WITH POSITIVE STEM-BASED IDENTITIES PERFORM BETTER ACADEMICALLY AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO PERSIST TO EARN A DEGREE AND STAY IN A STEM FIELD. HOWEVER, STEM-BASED IDENTITIES CAN CLASH WITH PERSONAL IDENTITIES, ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS FROM MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THIS PROJECT WILL ADD UNDERSTANDING IN HOW TO DEVELOP INTEGRATED IDENTITIES THAT INCORPORATE STEM IDENTITIES AND PERSONAL/CULTURAL IDENTITIES. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF INTEGRATED IDENTITIES, THE SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH TEAM WILL USE A MIXED-METHODS DESIGN. FINDINGS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED INTO CULTURALLY-ATTUNED, PLACE-BASED KNOWLEDGE THAT IS USEFUL FOR TEACHING, MENTORSHIP, AND POLICY IN STEM PROGRAMS AT TRIBAL AND NON-TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THIS PROJECT WILL DISSEMINATE RESEARCH FINDINGS, SUCCESSES, AND LESSONS LEARNED TO APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS VIA LOCAL AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS, PRESENTATIONS AT REGIONAL AND NATIONAL EVENTS, AND PUBLICATIONS IN RELEVANT JOURNALS. THESE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES WILL TAKE PLACE ON EACH CAMPUS AND WITHIN COMMUNITIES AS APPROPRIATE (E.G. TRIBAL COUNCIL MEETINGS, COMMUNITY FORUMS, AND CONTRIBUTION TO NEWSLETTERS, WEBSITES, AND OTHER VENUES). THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY NSF'S SCHOLARSHIPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS PROGRAM, WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOW-INCOME ACADEMICALLY TALENTED STUDENTS WITH DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED WHO EARN DEGREES IN STEM FIELDS.

CAS AFFECT 2-5% OF THE POPULATION. NEARLY 30,000 AMERICANS EACH YEAR SUFFER CA RUPTURE WITHOUT WARNING, RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY 50% MORTALITY. CAS ARE LARGELY ASYMPTOMATIC, AND THEREFORE USUALLY UNDETECTED UNTIL RUPTURED. BY PROVIDING THE FIRST BLOOD TEST ABLE TO DETECT AND EVALUATE CAS, THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE MONITORING AT FREQUENCIES NOT POSSIBLE TODAY. THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO OFFER A DYNAMIC RUPTURE RISK SCORE THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PATIENT CARE ROUTINE TO BETTER GUIDE PREOPERATIVE, INVASIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS. DECREASED TESTING COSTS ENABLED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROMOTE MORE REGULAR MONITORING AND EARLY ACTION, BENEFITING MINORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS WITH LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS WHO STRUGGLE TO ACCESS PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES AND BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS LIVING WITH UNRUPTURED CAS AND REDUCTIONS IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, AS WELL AS NEW INSIGHTS INTO CA PATHOGENESIS. THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BRING PEACE OF MIND TO THOSE IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT SEEKS TO ADVANCE THE FIRST SIMPLE, WHOLE BLOOD-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TEST TO DETECT THE PRESENCE AND MONITOR THE PROGRESSION OF A CEREBRAL ANEURYSM (CA). THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A DYNAMIC RUPTURE RISK SCORE AS WELL AS NOVEL ANEURYSM SUBGROUPINGS. CURRENTLY, CAS CAN ONLY BE DIAGNOSED WITH CEREBRAL IMAGING SUCH AS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY. THESE APPROACHES ARE NOT SUITED FOR REGULAR SCREENING DUE TO PROHIBITIVELY HIGH COSTS AND POTENTIAL RISKS. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT ANEURYSMS ARE DYNAMIC AND EXHIBIT DIFFERENT CYTOKINE SIGNATURES OVER TIME. WITH A CAREFULLY SELECTED PANEL OF CYTOKINES AND A PROPRIETARY MODEL, THESE INFLAMMATORY SIGNATURES CAN BE RELIABLY DIFFERENTIATED IN CA PATIENTS WITH UNRUPTURED AND RUPTURED ANEURYSMS. THIS PROJECT WILL GENERATE A ROBUST DATASET OF CA PATIENT BLOOD SAMPLES, WITH A FOCUS ON INCREASING SAMPLE REPRESENTATION FROM UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THE DATASET WILL BE USED TO TRAIN A PROPRIETARY PROBABILISTIC EQUATION TO DEVELOP A RISK OF RUPTURE METRIC.

INDIGENOUS PEOPLE USED FIRE FOR CENTURIES TO NOT ONLY ENSURE AMPLE SUPPLIES OF IMPORTANT RESOURCES, SUCH AS FOOD AND FIBER MATERIALS, BUT ALSO TO CONNECT WITH THE LAND. EUROPEAN COLONIZATION CHANGED THE CLOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND FIRE. TODAY, MANY LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES USE PRESCRIBED FIRE TO ACHIEVE SEVERAL GOALS, BUT THESE EFFORTS OFTEN HAVE LIMITED CULTURAL VALUE FOR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES.

MANY ESSENTIAL POLYMER MATERIALS HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT IS AT LEAST PARTIALLY CRYSTALLINE, MEANING THE ATOMS WITHIN THE MOLECULE ARRANGE THEMSELVES REGULARLY IN SPACE. CRYSTALLINITY PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DETERMINING THE PROPERTIES OF POLYMER MATERIALS, AND THUS IT IS CRITICAL THAT SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND MANIPULATE HOW AND WHEN POLYMERS CRYSTALLIZE. DESPITE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, THE EXACT MECHANISM BEHIND POLYMERS CRYSTALLIZATION REMAINS UNKNOWN. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPETING THEORIES, BUT EVIDENCE FROM EXPERIMENTS AND COMPUTER SIMULATIONS HAS BEEN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS PROJECT WILL APPLY A SIMULATION METHOD THAT WAS SUCCESSFULLY USED TO STUDY THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF NON-POLYMERS SUCH AS WATER TO STUDY POLYMERS. THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES WILL FOCUS ON STUDYING HOW THE LENGTH OF THE MOLECULES AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLYMERS AFFECT THE MECHANISM OF CRYSTALLIZATION. SUCCESS WITH THIS NEW APPROACH COULD REVOLUTIONIZE OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POLYMERS FORM CRYSTALS, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE NEW MATERIALS AND REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM EXISTING ONES. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITH RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL CREATE MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN UNDERGRADUATES AND K-12 STUDENTS, BETWEEN THE PI AND UNDERGRADUATES, BETWEEN MORE AND LESS EXPERIENCED GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND BETWEEN THE PI AND FUTURE SCIENTISTS THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PODCAST THAT FOCUSES ON CAREER DEVELOPMENT IN THE SCIENCES. TECHNICAL SUMMARY DESPITE DECADES OF RESEARCH, POLYMER SCIENCE LACKS A WIDELY ACCEPTED THEORY FOR CRYSTALLIZATION FROM THE MELT STATE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACCURATE THEORY OF POLYMER CRYSTALLIZATION WOULD NOT ONLY CHANGE TEXTBOOKS, BUT IT WOULD ALSO ENABLE THE CREATION OF NEW POLYMERS WITH BETTER PROPERTIES AND PROCESSES FOR MAKING POLYMERS WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. NUCLEATION PROCESSES ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO POLYMER CRYSTALLIZATION, BUT ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CLASSICAL NUCLEATION THEORY INADEQUATELY EXPLAINS HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION, LEADING RESEARCHERS TO PROPOSE CONTROVERSIAL ALTERNATIVE THEORIES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT EQUILIBRIUM ADVANCED SAMPLING METHODS CAN BE USED TO DIRECTLY CALCULATE THE NUCLEATION BARRIER TO TEST THESE NEW THEORIES. WHILE NEW TO POLYMER CRYSTALLIZATION, ADVANCED SAMPLING METHODS HAVE BEEN USED STUDY NUCLEATION IN OTHER FIELDS, AND THEY HAVE DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER METHODS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON A STUDY OF THE NUCLEATION BARRIER FOR FOLDED-CHAIN CRYSTALS AS A FUNCTION OF POLYMER MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND AS A FUNCTION OF POLYMER CHEMISTRY. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF SIMULATION SOFTWARE FOR COMPUTING FREE ENERGY LANDSCAPES IN LOW-TEMPERATURE POLYMER MELTS.

THESE STUDENTS ULTIMATELY HAVE BETTER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THAN THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEIR INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES ARE FIXED. THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN INTERVENTIONS TO FOSTER POSITIVE STUDENT BELIEFS. THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE CUSTOMIZED TO THE CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE DEVELOPING, IMPLEMENTING, AND ASSESSING THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES OF INTERVENTIONS TO HELP UNDERGRADUATE INTRODUCTORY BIOLOGY STUDENTS ADOPT MORE POSITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT THEIR ABILITIES. THE INTERVENTIONS? EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE ASSESSED USING A NEW, HIGH-QUALITY MEASURE OF STUDENTS? BELIEFS. THIS PROJECT WILL ANSWER PRESSING RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING INTERVENTIONS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES UNDERLYING THIS WORK. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE ADVANCING THE UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY AND IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. IMPORTANTLY, THIS PROJECT HAS POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE EQUITY IN ACADEMIC OUTCOMES BY BEING ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR STUDENTS WHO ENCOUNTER ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THESE STUDENTS INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THOSE FROM GROUPS TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM, AMONG OTHER MARGINALIZED GROUPS. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THREE OF THE MOST PRESSING RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MINDSET INTERVENTIONS COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS AND EQUITY IN SCIENCE. THE PROJECT?S RESEARCH QUESTIONS INCLUDE: (1) HOW DO MINDSET INTERVENTIONS AT TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS, STUDENT AND INSTRUCTOR, AFFECT STUDENT OUTCOMES INDEPENDENTLY AND IN CONCERT? (2) WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH MINDSET INTERVENTIONS AT BOTH THE STUDENT- AND INSTRUCTOR-LEVEL INFLUENCE STUDENTS? EXPERIENCES IN THE CLASSROOM, ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT, AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM? AND (3) HOW DO STUDENTS? RACIAL/ETHNIC IDENTITY AND GENERATION IN COLLEGE MODERATE ANY IDENTIFIED EFFECTS? THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED BY CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE, FULLY-CROSSED, RANDOMLY-ASSIGNED FIELD EXPERIMENTS IN INTRODUCTORY BIOLOGY COURSES AT FOUR SITES (N>10,000 STUDENTS). GROWTH MINDSET INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN GREAT POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS LARGE-SCALE EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES IN LOGISTICALLY SIMPLE, COST-EFFECTIVE WAYS. THIS PROJECT WILL CAPITALIZE ON THIS POTENTIAL BY INVESTIGATING HOW MINDSET MESSAGES FROM INSTRUCTORS ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THIS WORK WILL NOT ONLY HAVE BROAD IMPACTS BY ADDRESSING SOCIAL INEQUITIES TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION IN STEM, BUT WILL ALSO HAVE INTELLECTUAL MERIT BY GENERATING A MORE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CONTEXTUAL MESSAGES MODERATE INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS.

ABOUT 94% OF THIS WASTED FOOD ENDS UP IN LANDFILLS, INCINERATORS, AND MUNICIPAL SEWAGE SYSTEMS. IN LANDFILLS, THE DECOMPOSITION OF FOOD WASTE GENERATES GREENHOUSE GASES (METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE) AND OTHER BY-PRODUCTS THAT CAN CAUSE SOIL, AIR, AND WATER POLLUTION. BECAUSE FOOD WASTE IS A RENEWABLE SOURCE OF ORGANIC CARBON THAT CAN SUPPORT A CIRCULAR ECONOMY, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR NOVEL AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESSES FOR CONVERTING FOOD WASTE TO HIGH VALUE PRODUCTS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXPLORE THE CONVERSION OF BONELESS/ HOMOGENIZED FOOD WASTE INTO MESOPOROUS CARBON WHICH COULD BE USED TO FABRICATE ELECTRODES FOR SUPERCAPACITORS AND ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS. TO ADVANCE THIS GOAL, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) PROPOSE TO DESIGN, EVALUATE, AND OPTIMIZE A NOVEL 2-STAGE PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS OF A SURFACTANT ASSISTED HYDROTHERMAL CARBONIZATION (HTC) OF FOOD WASTE TO PRODUCE A HYDROCHAR PRECURSOR MATERIAL FOLLOWED THERMAL TREATMENT TO PRODUCE AN ELECTRODE-GRADE MESOPOROUS CARBON MATERIAL FOR PREPARING SUPERCAPACITORS WITH HIGH SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA (>2000 M2/G) AND ELECTRICAL CAPACITANCE (>275/F/G). THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT SOCIETY THROUGH THE GENERATION OF NEW DATA AND FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE TO ADVANCE THE CONVERSION OF FOOD WASTE TO MESOPOROUS CARBON FOR SUPERCAPACITORS AND ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH STUDENT EDUCATION AND TRAINING INCLUDING THE MENTORING OF ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AT OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY AND ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES AND TECHNOLOGY. FOOD WASTE IS A PROMISING RESOURCE AND FEEDSTOCK FOR ADVANCING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESSING AND CONVERSION OF FOOD WASTE TO VALUABLE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS INCLUDING ITS HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT, VARIABLE COMPOSITION, AND THE PRESENCE OF INORGANIC IMPURITIES. HYDROTHERMAL CARBONIZATION (HTC), WHICH CAN UTILIZE WATER AS A REACTION MEDIUM, HAS EMERGED AS PROMISING PROCESS FOR THE CONVERSION OF FOOD WASTE TO HIGH-VALUE ORGANIC PRODUCTS. IN THIS PROJECT, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) WILL EXPLORE THE ULIZATION OF SURFACTANT ASSISTED HTC TO CONVERT HOMOGENIZED AND BONELESS FOOD WASTE TO HYDROCHAR FOLLOWED BY THE THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE PRODUCED HYDROCHAR TO GENERATE AN ELECTRODE-GRADE MESOPOROUS CARBON FOR SUPERCAPACITORS AND ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS. THE GUIDING HYPOTHESES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE THAT 1) THE SELF-ASSEMBLY OF SURFACTANT MICELLES IN HYDROTHERMAL MEDIA WILL PROVIDE NUCLEATION AND GROWTH SITES FOR THE DISPERSED HYDROCHAR THAT FORMS DURING THE HTC OF FOOD WASTE AND 2) THE USE OF A SURFACTANT WILL OPEN THE PORES OF THE HYDROCHAR DURING THERMAL TREATMENT TO IMPROVE MESOPOROSITY, SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA, AND ION INTERCALATION. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH ARE TO 1) CONDUCT MECHANISTIC INVESTIGATIONS OF HYDROCHAR FORMATION DURING SURFACTANT ASSISTED HTC; 2) DEVELOP AND VALIDATE TREATMENT PROCESSES TO REMOVE METALLIC IMPURITIES FROM HYDROCHAR; 3) INVESTIGATE THE CHEMICAL-THERMAL TREATMENT OF THE SYNTHESIZED AND PURIFIED HYDROCHAR TO GENERATE MESOPOROUS CARBON; AND 4) CARRY OUT A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (TEA) TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING MESOPOROUS CARBON FROM FOOD WASTE FOR SUPERCAPACITOR MANUFACTURING AND ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS.

EXISTING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENT (MESA) PROGRAMS AT ALL THREE INSTITUTIONS WILL ALLOW THE PROJECT TO RECRUIT DIVERSE PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND STUDENTS FROM POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM. COMMUNITY COLLEGES GENERALLY SERVE MORE DIVERSE POPULATIONS THAN 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS, YET AT MANY INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE, STUDENTS FROM MINORITY POPULATIONS OFTEN TRANSFER AT LOWER RATES THAN THEIR PEERS. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH IS A HIGH-IMPACT PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE A RICH, ENGAGING EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS THAT CAN DRIVE GREATER EQUITY IN STUDENT RETENTION AND OVERALL SUCCESS. THIS PROJECT WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE BY EXPLORING HOW A 5-WEEK, PRE-TRANSFER RESEARCH EXPERIENCE THAT INCLUDES COHORT BUILDING ACTIVITIES IMPACTS THE SENSE OF BELONGING AND STEM SELF-EFFICACY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO COLLECT DATA ON HOW THE PROJECT MODEL CONTRIBUTES TO STUDENTS? LATER DECISION TO TRANSFER AND PURSUE A 4-YEAR DEGREE. THE CORE PROJECT MODEL WILL BE DISSEMINATED TO COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW 2- AND 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS CAN COLLABORATE TO INCREASE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND PERSISTENCE IN STEM. PROJECT EVALUATION WILL USE STUDENT AND FACULTY DATA TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT COMPONENTS WHILE EXAMINING THE SCALABILITY OF THE PROJECT MODEL WITH AN EYE TOWARDS FUTURE EXPANSION. THE HSI PROGRAM AIMS TO ENHANCE UNDERGRADUATE STEM EDUCATION, BROADEN PARTICIPATION IN STEM, AND BUILD CAPACITY AT HSIS.

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE WHCN, A MULTI-ORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN SIX PREDOMINANTLY WHITE INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN WOODS HOLE, MASSACHUSETTS. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON THREE QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT FEATURES AMONG THE WHCN PROMOTE OR INHIBIT INSTITUTIONAL AND DISCIPLINARY TRANSFORMATION? (2) IN WHAT WAYS HAS THE WHCN PURSUED EQUITABLE COLLABORATIONS AND HOW HAS THEIR COLLABORATION EVOLVED OVER TIME? (3) WHAT EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE FEATURES OF THE WHCN?S INITIATIVES CAN INFORM MCS COLLABORATIONS?

INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES (TAKEN BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS) OFTEN FALL SHORT OF THEIR POTENTIAL DUE TO OUTDATED TEACHING METHODS, CLASSROOM PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT INCLUSIVE, AND A PAUCITY OF DIVERSE ROLE MODELS. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STEM FIELDS THAT HAVE MADE STRIDES IN DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING INNOVATIVE TEACHING APPROACHES THAT WELCOME DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES, ECONOMICS HAS LAGGED BEHIND. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ABILITY OF ECONOMICS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IS COMPROMISED. THE LACK OF DIVERSITY NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE TOPICS STUDIED BUT ALSO LIMITS THE EXCHANGE OF DIVERSE IDEAS IN THE CLASSROOM, HINDERING BROADER SOCIETAL PROGRESS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING A CLASSROOM INTERVENTION USING EVIDENCE-BASED METHODS FROM STEM EDUCATION LITERATURE, WITH THE GOAL OF BROADENING PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMICS, ENHANCING STUDENT SENSE OF BELONGING, AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AND RETENTION IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF MODULES INSTRUCTORS CAN EASILY PLUG INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES DESIGNED TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO DIVERSE ROLE MODELS AND A RANGE OF EXCITING AND RELEVANT TOPICS THROUGH PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED VIDEOS. ACCOMPANYING CURRICULAR MATERIALS, GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED ACTIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLES, WILL DEEPEN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING. THE PROJECT HYPOTHESIZES THAT THIS INTERVENTION WILL POSITIVELY INFLUENCE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ECONOMICS, STRENGTHEN THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING IN ECONOMICS AND THEIR BELIEF IN THEIR OWN ABILITIES, AND IMPROVE LEARNING, PERSISTENCE, AND RETENTION, PARTICULARLY AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS. THE MODULES WILL ALSO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMICS INSTRUCTORS, ENABLING THEM TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER THESE EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES AND DELIVERING THEM TO THE INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS CLASSROOM, THIS TIER 1 PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE IUSE: EDU PROGRAM'S ENGAGED STUDENT LEARNING TRACK, AIMING TO IMPROVE ECONOMICS EDUCATION, ENGAGE STUDENTS THROUGH INNOVATIVE AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES, ENHANCE DIVERSITY, AND PREPARE STUDENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO FURTHERS THE NSF MISSION BY EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE ON STEM EDUCATION AND INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE US TO CONDUCT RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS, A CRUCIAL STEM FIELD, BY CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE VIBRANT AND DIVERSE ECONOMICS WORKFORCE. THIS PROJECT USES A MIXED METHODS RESEARCH APPROACH BY INCORPORATING FOCUS GROUP INPUT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT MODULES AND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR IMPACT EVALUATION. THE PROJECT TEAM PLANS TO DEPLOY THE MODULES IN CLASSES AT VARIED TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH INSTRUCTORS. EACH INSTRUCTOR WILL HAVE A ?CONTROL? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY DO NOT USE THE MODULES AND A ?TREATMENT? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT THE PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS THAT WILL BE USED TO COLLECT DATA ON CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS STEM IDENTITY, SELF-EFFICACY, CONNECTEDNESS AND BELONGING, AND PERCEPTIONS OF PERSISTENCE IN ECONOMICS. COMBINING THAT DATA WITH INSTITUTIONAL DATA, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL PERFORM DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES REGRESSIONS TO ANALYZE PROJECT IMPACTS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT LIES IN LEVERAGING THE EXISTING EVIDENCE ABOUT ACTIVE LEARNING AND ROLE MODELS TO CREATE A NOVEL SET OF MODULES, COMBINING DIVERSE ROLE MODELS, POLICY RELEVANCE, AND ACTIVE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO SHAPE DIVERSE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS, IDENTITY, AND PERSISTENCE.

AS A RESULT OF THIS PERSISTENT UNDERREPRESENTATION, LATINX K-12 STUDENTS LACK ROLE MODELS WITH CAREERS IN THESE FIELDS -- ESPECIALLY IN ENGINEERING. IN ADDITION, SOMETIMES ENGINEERING IN K-12 EDUCATION IS NOT PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT EXCITES THE INTERESTS OF STUDENTS FROM A VARIETY OF ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. HAVING FULL REPRESENTATION FROM ALL GROUPS THAT MAKE UP THE RICH AND DIVERSE TALENT IN THE U.S. IS CRUCIAL TO REACH OUR FULL POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCEMENT IN THE STEM FIELDS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL STUDENTS CAN BE ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE STEM DEGREES, PARTICULARLY LATINX STUDENTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXPLORE HOW TEACHERS, AS IMMEDIATE ROLE MODELS, CAN SERVE AS MEDIATORS AND AGENTS OF POSITIVE CHANGE FOR LATINX MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. TEACHERS CAN BECOME AGENTS OF POSITIVE CHANGE WHEN THEY LEARN HOW TO INTEGRATE THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES (ALSO KNOWN AS FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE) THAT STUDENTS BRING INTO THE CLASSROOM TO ENGINEERING CONTENT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR TEACHERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ENGINEERING CONNECTS WITH THE REALITIES OF LATINX STUDENTS' LIVED EXPERIENCES AT HOME AND AT THEIR COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN ENGINEERING. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO BUILD TEACHER CAPACITY TO HELP STUDENTS LINK THESE IN-SCHOOL AND OUT-OF-SCHOOL EXPERIENCES. DOING SO PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR STUDENTS TO GET EXCITED AND FEEL EMPOWERED TO BECOME FUTURE ENGINEERS. BY BUILDING A MORE INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION, TEACHERS OF K-12 STUDENTS, INCLUDING THEIR LATINX STUDENTS, CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DIVERSIFYING AND INCREASING THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS PREPARED TO PURSUE CAREERS IN ENGINEERING. CURRENTLY, THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH AROUND HOW TO DEVELOP TEACHERS' CAPACITY TO INTEGRATE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE WITH ENGINEERING, OR THE IMPACT OF SUCH INTEGRATION ON STUDENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT, THEREFORE, IS (1) TO EXPLORE HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE INTEGRATION OF FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE WITH ENGINEERING DESIGN CAN FACILITATE LATINX STUDENTS' INTEREST IN ENGINEERING, AND (2) HOW TO DEVELOP TEACHERS' CAPACITIES FOR ACTIVATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING STUDENTS' FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN A PREDOMINANTLY LATINX AREA IN THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER WITH A HIGH ELL POPULATION. IT (1) OFFERS TEACHERS THE OPPORTUNITIES, STRUCTURE, AND SUPPORT TO RECOGNIZE, VALUE, AND ACTIVATE LATINX STUDENTS' FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN RELATION TO ENGINEERING; AND (2) CREATES A STRUCTURE AND CULTURE THAT HELPS LATINX STUDENTS CULTIVATE THEIR OWN AWARENESS OF THEIR FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS THEIR INTEREST IN AND KNOWLEDGE OF ENGINEERING. THE SAMPLE INCLUDES EIGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHERS, AND ONE ENGINEERING TEACHER. EACH TEACHER IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRICULA THAT INTEGRATE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN ENGINEERING CONTEXTS WITH AT LEAST ONE CLASS OF 25 STUDENTS, TOTALING 225 STUDENTS PER YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION. THIS MIXED METHODS STUDY USES DATA FROM OBSERVATIONS, INTERVIEWS, DIGITAL LOGS, FOCUS GROUPS, ARTIFACTS AND SURVEYS, AS WELL AS BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES METHODS, TO STUDY HOW THE INTEGRATION OF FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND ENGINEERING OCCURS. THE STUDY ADDRESSES THE NEED TO PROMOTE A MORE EQUITABLE FORMATION OF ENGINEERS WHERE DIVERSE VOICES ARE ACKNOWLEDGED. THUS, THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATED IN THIS STUDY IS ESSENTIAL FOR CREATING FUTURE ENGINEERS AND CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHERS.

DNA SEQUENCING IS USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES IN RESEARCH AND MEDICINE ? FOR EXAMPLE, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES, MONITORING OF PATHOGENS IN WATER SUPPLIES AND FOOD, AND STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON HUMAN, CROP, AND PET HEALTH. YET NEARLY 50% OF THE WORLD?S POPULATION HAS LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO SUCH ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS TOOLS, AND AT LEAST 2.2 BILLION PEOPLE LACKED SAFE DRINKING WATER IN 2022. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS HIGH INTEREST IN GENETIC TESTING AMONG INDIVIDUALS OF LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, SUCH TESTS ARE INACCESSIBLE DUE TO COST OR AVAILABILITY. THE GLOBAL DNA SEQUENCING MARKET SIZE OF $11B IN 2022 IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO OVER $50B BY 2032. THIS PROJECT IS DISRUPTING THE STATUS QUO AND ADDRESSING AN UNSERVED MARKET BY DEVELOPING A SMALL, PORTABLE, AUTOMATED, HIGH THROUGHPUT, AND COST-EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR EXTRACTING DNA FROM A VARIETY OF BIOSAMPLES TO PREPARE THEM FOR NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING. THE IN-SPACE ENVIRONMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEVERAGE MICROGRAVITY ADVANTAGES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY-BASED ADVANCES BUT IS CURRENTLY CAPACITY AND THROUGHPUT-CONSTRAINED. THIS PROJECT WILL FURTHER ACCELERATE A HIGH-THROUGHPUT, FASTER ITERATIVE APPROACH TO IN-SPACE R&D TO ACHIEVE MORE OF THE DISRUPTIVE SOLUTIONS POSSIBLE FROM MICROGRAVITY. THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT PROPOSES A UNIQUE APPROACH TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ? BUILDING THE TECHNOLOGY FOR SPACE AND MICROGRAVITY, THE MOST EXTREME ENVIRONMENT. CURRENTLY, NO SUCH AUTOMATED, MINIATURIZED TECHNOLOGY EXISTS IN SPACE FOR DNA EXTRACTION AND SAMPLE PREPARATION. SPACE IS A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN OFFER NOVEL SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADVANCED TOOLS IN MICROGRAVITY, SUCH AS THE TECHNOLOGY PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT, WILL ENABLE SCIENTISTS TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF KNOWLEDGE ACROSS A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES, FROM AGING AND LONGEVITY RESEARCH TO CANCER MEDICINES TO STEM CELL EXPANSION AND ORGANOID PRODUCTION IN SPACE. FURTHERMORE, BY SOLVING FOR SPACE ? AN EXTREME, HARSH ENVIRONMENT WITH MANY CONSTRAINTS ? THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO SOLVE FOR EARTH?S AUSTERE ENVIRONMENTS AND PROVIDE A HIGH-CALIBER DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR POPULATIONS IN REMOTE, UNDERSERVED, UNDER-RESOURCED, AND EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES MILITARY FIELD OPERATIONS FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY IN SPACE AND DEMOCRATIZING HEALTH AND WELFARE ON EARTH. THE FIRST PRODUCT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A SERIES OF PRODUCTS FOR PORTABLE ADVANCED END-POINT-ANALYSIS TOOLS. THE PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY WILL SPIN OFF SUBSEQUENT DEVICES THAT WILL EVENTUALLY ENABLE IN-HOME OR POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTICS.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS THAT GENERATE BIODIVERSITY IS CRUCIAL FOR CONSERVING AND MANAGING SPECIES OVER THE LONG TERM. MUCH OF THE PLANET?S BIODIVERSITY HAS BEEN GENERATED THROUGH ADAPTIVE RADIATION, A PROCESS IN WHICH A GROUP OF ORGANISMS DIVERSIFIES INTO MANY NEW SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL ROLES. HOWEVER, WE LACK A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENOMIC CHANGES UNDERLYING THESE EVENTS, PARTICULARLY IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS WHERE THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS BARRIERS TO MIGRATION. ROCKFISHES IN THE GENUS SEBASTES ARE A HIGHLY DIVERSE (>110 SPECIES) GROUP OF FISHES THAT LIVE ACROSS A RANGE OF DEPTHS AND HABITATS, MAKING THEM AN EXCELLENT MODEL FOR STUDYING THE DYNAMICS OF DIVERSIFICATION. THIS CAREER PROJECT WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SPECIES DIVERSIFY BY EXAMINING THE GENOMIC PROCESSES UNDERLYING SPECIATION IN ROCKFISHES, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING SHIFTS IN HABITAT, BODY SHAPE, SIZE AND COLOR AMONG SISTER SPECIES. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS INTEGRATED WITH EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AND TEACHER TRAINING, WITH THE GOAL OF CONTRIBUTING TO A STRONG AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THIS STUDY WILL COMBINE GENOMIC DATA WITH INFORMATION ON PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY, ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY TO DEVELOP A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF DIVERSIFICATION IN THIS EXTRAORDINARILY SPECIES-RICH GENUS. THE FIRST AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO CONSTRUCT AN UPDATED, TIME-CALIBRATED PHYLOGENETIC FRAMEWORK FOR ROCKFISHES USING PHYLOGENOMIC METHODS. IN THE SECOND AIM, WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING WILL BE USED TO INFER LIKELY DIVERGENCE SCENARIOS AMONG SYMPATRIC SPECIES PAIRS, CHARACTERIZE PATTERNS OF GENOMIC DIFFERENTIATION, AND RECONSTRUCT DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORIES OF LINEAGES IN THE CONTEXT OF SPECIATION EVENTS AND OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA. THE THIRD AIM WILL EXAMINE THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GENOMIC AND ECOMORPHOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE BY ASSESSING OVERLAP BETWEEN SISTER SPECIES ACROSS A SUITE OF HABITAT FACTORS AND QUANTITATIVE PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERS. THESE RESEARCH AIMS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES VIA THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCAFFOLDED SET OF CLASSROOM-BASED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES, AND THE CREATION OF A LEARNING AND MENTORING COMMUNITY FOCUSED AROUND BIODIVERSITY AND EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBER OF BLACK, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FACULTY HAS REMAINED LOW FOR THE LAST DECADE DESPITE TARGETED RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE TOXIC AND OPPRESSIVE CULTURE OF EXCLUSION, DEVALUING, AND BIAS DISCOURAGES MANY FROM PURSUING AN ACADEMIC CAREER AND PREVENTS TALENTED, BLACK FACULTY FROM SUCCEEDING. TO REDUCE THIS RACIALLY CENTERED LOSS FROM ENGINEERING, THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO USE A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY BASED METHODS SUCH AS SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS TO INVESTIGATE ACTIVITIES THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING PROGRAMS CAN ADOPT TO SUPPORT BLACK JUNIOR FACULTY IN THEIR CAREER PROGRESSION. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE, EASY-TO-USE GUIDANCE MANUAL TO EVALUATE THE PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS OF JUNIOR FACULTY IN THREE AREAS: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PROMOTION & TENURE AND JOB SATISFACTION & SUPPORT. THE BENEFIT OF THIS WORK TO SOCIETY RESULTS FROM PROVIDING A TOOL THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF RACIALLY DIVERSE FACULTY.

HOWEVER, THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE OFTEN UNAVAILABLE TO THOSE FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES (CCS) AND MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS (MSIS), DUE TO FINANCIAL, SOCIAL, AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FURTHER EXACERBATED THESE CHALLENGES, LIMITING IN-PERSON FIELD OPPORTUNITIES. TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO FIELD EXPERIENCES, THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE FIELD BIOLOGY EXPERIENCES BROADLY ACCESSIBLE. BY UNITING FSMLS, VIRTUAL LEARNING EXPERTS, VIDEOGRAPHERS, AND EDUCATORS, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BRIDGE THE GAP AND BRING SCIENCE EDUCATION TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE BROADER GOAL OF INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE FIELD SCIENCES. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TRAINING IN INQUIRY- AND EVIDENCE-BASED TEACHING, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL MATERIALS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING MATERIALS BY THE RESEARCH COORDINATION NETWORK (RCN) FACULTY AND FIELD STATION AND MARINE LABS (FSMLS). AN ONLINE COMMUNITY WILL BE CREATED TO ENCOURAGE THE SHARING OF IDEAS FOR CREATING EFFECTIVE VIRTUAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES SEVEN ANNUAL ORIENTATION AND TRAINING WORKSHOPS WHERE EXPERTS WILL PRESENT ON VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY SKILLS, CLASSROOM USE, AND EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT. THESE WORKSHOPS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FACILITATED DISCUSSIONS, BREAKOUT SESSIONS, AND FEEDBACK COLLECTION. THE PROJECT AIMS TO COLLECT FEEDBACK ON THE NEEDS OF NETWORK PARTICIPANTS, IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CONTENT, EXPLORE COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND DEVELOP COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE DOCUMENTS FOR FACULTY AND FSMLS. ADDITIONAL BIMONTHLY OFFICE HOURS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PARTICIPANTS AND ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE PROJECT TO SEEK SUPPORT AND CLARIFICATION.

HOWEVER, EXISTING MODELS OFTEN FAIL TO CONSIDER UNDERREPORTED CLINICAL CASES, RESULTING IN INACCURATE ESTIMATES OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND FLAWED FORECASTS. MEANWHILE, WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE HAS EMERGED AS A PROMISING TOOL FOR CAPTURING DATA FROM A DIVERSE POPULATION, INCLUDING ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE NOT CAPTURED BY CLINICAL TESTING. DESPITE ITS POTENTIAL, INTEGRATING WASTEWATER DATA WITH MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES REMAINS LARGELY UNEXPLORED. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY LEVERAGING WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE DATA TO ENHANCE THE CALIBRATION OF DYNAMIC POPULATION-LEVEL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS. BY INCORPORATING WASTEWATER DATA, THE PROJECT SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE ESTIMATION OF TRUE DISEASE PREVALENCE, ENHANCE FORECASTING OF FUTURE CASES, AND MONITOR THE EMERGENCE AND EVOLUTION OF VIRAL VARIANTS. THE DEVELOPED MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORKS WILL BE VITAL FOR THE ONGOING MONITORING OF COVID-19 AND SIMILAR DISEASES, ENABLING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS AND PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE CURRICULUM AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AT LAWRENCE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM IN MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORKS USED TO MODEL INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPREAD, WHICH OFTEN SUFFERS FROM INADEQUATE CALIBRATION DUE TO UNDERREPORTED CASES RESULTING FROM ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS AND LOW SELF-REPORTING. AS A CONSEQUENCE, CRITICAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS THE BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER, ARE POORLY ESTIMATED, LEADING TO INACCURATE FORECASTS AND A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS DRIVING INFECTION TRANSMISSION. TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP MECHANISTIC MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT ENHANCE TRADITIONAL SIR-TYPE (SUSCEPTIBLE-INFECTIOUS-RECOVERED) MODELS, COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SYSTEM OF ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. THESE ENHANCED MODELS WILL INCORPORATE TWO ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF DATA: VIRAL RNA COPIES FOUND IN WASTEWATER AND VIRAL RNA COPIES FOUND IN STOOL SAMPLES. THE INCORPORATION OF WASTEWATER VIRAL RNA COPIES WILL INTRODUCE A NEW VARIABLE INTO THE SIR-TYPE MODEL, GOVERNING THE DYNAMICS OF VIRAL CONCENTRATION IN WASTEWATER OVER TIME. THE VIRAL SHEDDING CURVE, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS SHED BY AN AVERAGE INFECTED PERSON OVER TIME, WILL BE MODELED PHENOMENOLOGICALLY USING PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM CLINICAL STOOL SAMPLES. TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE SHEDDING CURVE AND GAIN INSIGHTS INTO ITS UNDERLYING MECHANISMS, A WITHIN-HOST VIRUS MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED, INCORPORATING UNINFECTED CELLS, INFECTED CELLS, AND IMMUNE RESPONSES WITHIN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. THE OVERALL MODELING FRAMEWORK WILL BE EXTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR VIRUS VARIANTS BY DIVIDING THE INFECTIOUS CLASS INTO DISTINCT COMPARTMENTS, EACH WITH VARIANT-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS TRANSMISSIBILITY, VACCINE RESISTANCE AND REINFECTION RATE. THE RESULTING MATHEMATICAL MODELS WILL BE ANALYZED, NUMERICALLY SIMULATED, AND PARAMETERIZED USING APPROPRIATE DATASETS.

SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY FOR RESEARCHERS OF COLOR TO ATTEND AND SUCCESSFULLY MANEUVER THESE CONFERENCES. OFTEN, THOSE RESEARCHERS WHO DO ATTEND ARE ONE OF A HANDFUL AND THEIR EXPERIENCES CAN BE RIDDLED WITH ISOLATION, MAKING IT HARD TO TRULY ENGAGE IN MEETING SESSIONS AND ACTIVITIES. TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND ENGAGEMENT OF SCIENTISTS OF COLOR AT OCEAN SCIENCE CONFERENCES AND REDUCE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES STEMMING FROM SECLUSION, THE NON-PROFIT BLACK IN MARINE SCIENCE (BIMS) INTRODUCES THE BIMS TIDAL WAVE. THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO 1) PROVIDE A COHORT OF SCIENTISTS THE NETWORKING AND TECHNICAL SKILLS NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY PRESENT AT A CONFERENCE, 2) INCORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS OF RESEARCHERS OF COLOR IN OCEAN SCIENCE CONFERENCES INCLUDING A CONFERENCE HOSTED BY THE BIMS INSTITUTE AND 3) INCREASE COHESION AMONG ALLIES AND BLACK PROFESSIONALS WHO FOCUS ON OCEAN CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH. EACH YEAR, A COHORT OF BLACK MARINE SCIENTISTS AT VARIED EDUCATIONAL LEVELS (UNDERGRAD TO GRADUATE) AND PROFESSIONS (ACADEMIC, GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR) WILL BE SELECTED TO ATTEND ONE OCEAN SCIENCE CONFERENCE. PRIOR TO EACH CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS WILL PARTAKE IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS FOCUSED ON PRESENTING RESEARCH, NETWORKING, AND SUCCESSFUL MENTOR-MENTEE INTERACTIONS. AFTER EACH CONFERENCE, COHORTS WILL RECEIVE POST-CONFERENCE TRAINING THAT WILL ASSIST PARTICIPANTS IN PUBLISHING THEIR RESEARCH AND FORMING COLLABORATIVE BONDS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING THE DIVERSITY AND EXPERIENCE OF BLACK MARINE SCIENTISTS AT SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES, THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BLACK IN MARINE SCIENCE INTRODUCES THE BIMS TIDAL WAVE. THIS PROGRAM AIMS TO EXPAND THE DIVERSITY OF MARINE SCIENCE CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION AND SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP IN A STEPWISE FASHION, SUPPORTING 40 STUDENTS, AND BOTH EARLY & LATE CAREER PROFESSIONALS IN PRESENTING RESEARCH AT TWO MARINE SCIENCE MEETINGS EACH YEAR. MOVING PAST THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING ISOLATED AND EXCLUDED AT CONFERENCES, THE GOAL IS THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE TIDAL WAVE PROGRAM FEEL A BOOST IN CONFIDENCE AND IN A SENSE OF BELONGING BY HAVING NEW SKILLS, RESOURCES, AND COHORT SUPPORT. THESE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WILL ALTER THE EXPERIENCE OF BOTH BLACK SCIENTISTS AND OTHER ATTENDEES AT THE CONFERENCE. PRIOR TO THE MEETINGS, THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE HANDS-ON NETWORKING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS INCLUDING THE RESOURCES, SUPPORT, AND SKILLS NEEDED TO NAVIGATE A CONFERENCE SUCCESSFULLY. THESE WORKSHOPS WILL STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS AND MUTUAL SUPPORT AMONG PARTICIPANTS, THEREBY INCREASING THE SENSE OF COMFORT AND EASE OF ATTENDING.

EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR SOCIOECONOMIC VITALITY AND BROAD QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT. STRONG, RELIABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SPURS PRIVATE-SECTOR INNOVATION, GROWS THE ECONOMY, CREATES JOBS, MAKES PUBLIC-SECTOR SERVICE PROVISION MORE EFFICIENT, STRENGTHENS COMMUNITIES, PROMOTES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, PROTECTS THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCES NATIONAL SECURITY, AND FUELS AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS REQUIRES EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES. SAI FOCUSES ON HOW KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN REASONING AND DECISION MAKING, GOVERNANCE, AND SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PROCESSES ENABLES THE BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE OF EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IMPROVES LIVES AND SOCIETY AND BUILDS ON ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING. AMERICAN LIFELINE INFRASTRUCTURES, SUCH AS DRINKABLE WATER, POWER SYSTEMS, AND GROUND TRANSPORTATION, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY, ORGANIZATIONS, AND EXPERTISE THAT KEEP AMERICANS ALIVE AND WORKING. THEY ARE HIGHLY INTERDEPENDENT AND REQUIRE EACH OTHER?S FUNCTIONING FOR NORMAL OPERATION. YET PACIFIC NORTHWEST INFRASTRUCTURES ARE UNDER-PREPARED FOR THE CASCADIA SUBDUCTION ZONE (CSZ) EARTHQUAKE (MAGNITUDE 9.0+), WITH A 7-15% PROBABILITY OVER THE NEXT 45 YEARS OR SO. IT LIKELY WILL DESTROY OR DAMAGE MANY INFRASTRUCTURES AT THE SAME TIME, MAKING LIFE DIFFICULT FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AS THESE LIFELINES ARE SLOWLY RESTORED ACROSS THE REGION. THIS PROJECT EXAMINES HOW OPERATORS AND MANAGERS?SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERT STAFF WHO KEEP THE DRINKABLE WATER, POWER GRID, AND GROUND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES GOING?ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE SUCH RARE EXTREME HAZARDS. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO TRANSFORM HOW THE U.S. PREPARES FOR THE NEXT CSZ EARTHQUAKE, BY IMPROVING COORDINATED PREPAREDNESS AND RECOVERY OF INTERDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURES AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE, AND INFORMING HOW THESE INTERDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURES ARE DESIGNED, DEVELOPED, AND MAINTAINED TO ENHANCE THEIR RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY. AVOIDING WASTE IN COORDINATED RECOVERY OF THESE VARIOUS LIFELINE INFRASTRUCTURES COULD SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES AS WELL AS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE U.S. ECONOMY EVERY DAY. THE RESEARCH TEAM IS CONDUCTING TABLE-TOP EMERGENCY RESPONSE EXERCISES, DETAILED INTERVIEWS, AND GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND WITH CONTROL ROOM OPERATORS, MAINTENANCE SUPERVISORS, REAL-TIME SUPPORT STAFF, AND MANAGERS ACROSS POTABLE WATER, THE POWER GRID, AND GROUND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES. THESE ACTIVITIES HELP TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL SHARED OR INTERCONNECTED CONTROL VARIABLES (E.G., ELECTRICAL VOLTAGES, RESERVOIR RELEASE RATES, MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES) THAT MAY SEVERELY HAMPER COORDINATED RECOVERY IF NOT ACKNOWLEDGED AND PLANNED FOR. THESE DATA ARE USED TO DEVELOP AN AGENT-BASED MODEL (ABM), A COMPUTER MODEL THAT INCORPORATES HUMAN BEHAVIOR DATA INTO THE DESIGN OF ?AGENTS? WHO RESPOND TO VARIOUS SITUATIONS, TO IDENTIFY THE OUTCOMES OF VARIOUS EARTHQUAKE AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSE SCENARIOS BEYOND THOSE USED IN THE INTERVIEW/DISCUSSION/EXERCISE WORK. KEY INFORMANTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN WASHINGTON AND OREGON, THE STATES MOST VULNERABLE TO CONSEQUENCES OF A CSZ EARTHQUAKE, WILL BE CONSULTED AND INFORMED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT TO MAXIMIZE ITS VALUE, WITH WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF RESULTS TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH POLICY BRIEFS, WHITE PAPERS, AND PRESENTATIONS TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE FOR PRACTITIONERS. THE PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR A NEW DECISION-AID TOOL TO BE FURTHER RESEARCHED AND DEVELOPED. THIS PROJECT?S PROPOSED INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE (E.G., ORGANIZATIONAL OPERATIONS ANALYSIS, TRUST, VALUES) AND ENGINEERING THEORIES AND METHODS (E.G., RESILIENCE ENGINEERING, ABM) IS LARGELY UNTESTED BUT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE FIRST INSIGHTS INTO HOW INTERORGANIZATIONAL PROCESSES SUPPORT OR HINDER COORDINATED RECOVERY OF INTERDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURES.

COMPARED TO STEEL AND NON-FERROUS ALLOYS, DUCTILE IRON CASTINGS ARE EASY TO MANUFACTURE BY ESTABLISHED METAL CASTING PROCESSES. DUCTILE IRONS ARE WIDELY USED TO PRODUCE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS IN AUTOMOTIVE, AGRICULTURE, MINING, CONSTRUCTION, MUNICIPAL WATER/SEWER, AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES AND ARE EASILY RECYCLABLE. THIS RESEARCH IS AIMED AT PROVIDING AN ECONOMICAL METHOD TO IMPROVE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE AS-CAST DUCTILE IRON VIA REFINING ITS GRAIN STRUCTURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF EXPENSIVE ALLOYING ELEMENT ADDITIONS OR ENERGY-INTENSIVE HEAT TREATMENT. THIS AWARD SUPPORTS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO PROVIDE THE NEEDED KNOWLEDGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST IN-SITU GRAIN REFINEMENT PROCESS FOR AUSTENITIC DUCTILE IRON. THE REFINED GRAIN STRUCTURE IMPROVES THE STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS OF THE DUCTILE IRON, WHICH LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHER STRENGTH-TO-MASS RATIO CASTINGS AND THINNER SECTION AND LIGHTER WEIGHT COMPONENTS. THE BENEFITS OF LIGHTWEIGHT DUCTILE IRON CAST PARTS ARE REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CARBON EMISSION DURING PRODUCTION, SERVICE, AND RECYCLING, WHICH BENEFITS THE U.S. ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. THIS RESEARCH INVOLVES SEVERAL DISCIPLINES INCLUDING METALLURGY, MATERIALS SCIENCE, AND MANUFACTURING. THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH HELPS BROADEN PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN RESEARCH AND POSITIVELY IMPACTS ENGINEERING EDUCATION. REFINEMENT OF AUSTENITE IN DUCTILE IRON CAN RESULT IN A FINER FINAL MICROSTRUCTURE IMPROVING ITS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, THE APPROACH TO ACHIEVE IN-SITU AUSTENITE GRAIN REFINEMENT DURING THE MELTING AND SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS AND THE ASSOCIATED MECHANISMS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. A NICKEL-ALLOYED DUCTILE IRON IS DESIGNED WITH THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS TO RETAIN AUSTENITE STRUCTURE DURING SOLIDIFICATION. FOUR ELEMENTAL ADDITIONS, CERIUM, TITANIUM, ALUMINUM, AND BISMUTH ARE SELECTED. THE SELECTED ALLOYING ADDITIONS ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO REFINE THE AUSTENITE MICROSTRUCTURE EITHER BY PROMOTING HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION OF AUSTENITE GRAINS, OR BY IMPEDING AUSTENITE GRAIN GROWTH. TO DETERMINE THE GRAIN REFINEMENT MECHANISM, PARTIALLY SOLIDIFIED IRON IS QUENCHED TO CAPTURE EARLY FORMATION OF AUSTENITE ON NUCLEATION SITES AND RETAIN GROWTH FRONT OF AUSTENITE GRAIN IN CONTACT WITH LIQUID. SAMPLES ARE ANALYZED USING ELECTRON BACK SCATTERED DIFFRACTION, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, ENERGY DISPERSIVE X-RAY, TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, AND SELECTED AREA ELECTRON DIFFRACTION TO UNDERSTAND THE AUSTENITE GRAIN REFINEMENT MECHANISM. THE PROJECT EVALUATES PROCESSING-STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS IN THE GRAIN REFINED NICKEL-ALLOYED DUCTILE IRON IN THE AS-CAST STATE.

THE LC-NE SYSTEM PROJECTS BROADLY THROUGHOUT THE CNS AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REGULATE COGNITION AND SENSORY SIGNAL PROCESSING ACROSS ALL STAGES OF WAKEFULNESS. ALTHOUGH IT PROMINENTLY INNERVATES MOTOR CENTERS OF THE BRAIN, A SIMILAR ROLE FOR THE SYSTEM IN REGULATING POSTURE, BALANCE, REFLEX AND GOAL-DIRECTED MOVEMENT ACROSS THE WAKING STATE IS LARGELY UNEXPLORED. WITH DEVELOPMENT OF NEW METHODOLOGY FOR VISUALIZATION OF LC NEURONS THAT SEND PROJECTIONS TO CNS MOTOR CIRCUITS, THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF LC-NE INPUTS TO MOTOR CENTERS WILL BE DETERMINED. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT WILL ADVANCE OUR THINKING ABOUT HOW THE LC-NE SYSTEM EXERTS INFLUENCES ON NOT ONLY MOTOR ACTIVITY BUT ALSO SENSORY SIGNAL PROCESSING AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS. MORE BROADLY THERE ARE BRAIN-WIDE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS APPROACH RELATIVE TO A HOST OF TRANSMITTER-SPECIFIC PATHWAYS IN THE CNS AND THE PROJECT ITSELF CAN BE USED AS A TRAINING PLATFORM FOR A NEXT GENERATION OF NEUROSCIENTISTS.

HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY AND ELSEWHERE HAVE PROVIDED COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT LC IS MODULAR IN DESIGN, WITH SEGREGATED OUTPUT CHANNELS TO SENSORY, MOTOR, AND COGNITIVE CIRCUITRIES THROUGHOUT THE CNS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DIFFERENTIAL RELEASE OF NE IN THESE FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE PROJECTION FIELDS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE PROMPTED A RADICAL SHIFT IN THINKING ABOUT LC OPERATIONS AND DEMAND REVISION OF THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE LC-NE SYSTEM ON BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES INVOLVING NOT ONLY SENSORY AND COGNITIVE DOMAINS BUT ALSO MOVEMENT GENERATION.

THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PLATE TECTONICS AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF CONTINENTAL BREAK UP AND THE SUBSEQUENT FORMATION OF NEW OCEANS. AS CONTINENTAL FRAGMENTS DRIFT APART AND NEW OCEANS FORM BETWEEN THE LAND MASSES, THE INFLUENTIAL HOTSPOT PERSISTS. THIS HOTSPOT THEN CREATES A SERIES OF SMALLER VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ON THE NEW SEAFLOOR. THESE ERUPTIONS SAMPLE THE DEEP HOTSPOT AND, IN SOME CASES, THE SHALLOW MANTLE. HOWEVER, THE SHALLOW MANTLE IS NOT UNIFORM IN COMPOSITION. INSTEAD, IT EVOLVES AS CONTINENTS DRIFT APART AND NEW SEAFLOOR IS CREATED.

DEEP IN THE EARTH, CLAY, SANDSTONE, AND LIMESTONE ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CRYSTALLINE METAMORPHIC ROCKS LIKE SCHISTS, QUARTZITES, AND MARBLES. CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT TRANSFORM SEDIMENTARY MINERALS INTO METAMORPHIC MINERALS CAN ALSO RELEASE FLUIDS SUCH AS WATER (H2O) AND CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), ORIGINALLY TRAPPED IN THE SEDIMENTARY MINERALS. THESE FLUIDS HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON EARTH PROCESSES SUCH AS THE FORMATION OF VOLCANOES, THE TRIGGERING OF EARTHQUAKES, AND THE FORMATION OF VALUABLE ORE DEPOSITS.

THE FIELD, LABORATORY AND GEOCHRONOLOGICAL STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON A COMPARISON OF ROCKS FROM THE SAME OUTCROP THAT DISPLAY NUMEROUS SMALL GARNETS AND FEW LARGE GARNETS. NUCLEATION THEORY PREDICTS THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW CRYSTALS (I.E. NUCLEI) THAT FORM UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS IS A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF OVERSTEPPING OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REACTION (CALLED THE ?AFFINITY?). THE PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS OF GARNET FORMATION WILL BE DETERMINED FROM A COMBINATION OF INCLUSION BAROMETRY USING RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AND TRACE ELEMENT THERMOMETRY (E.G., QUARTZ OR GRAPHITE-IN-GARNET; ZR IN RUTILE THERMOMETRY) TO SEE IF GARNETS NUCLEATED AT CONSISTENT DISPLACEMENTS FROM THE EQUILIBRIUM ISOGRAD FOR THE BULK COMPOSITION OR WHETHER THEY NUCLEATED AT SIMILAR P?T CONDITIONS, WHICH WOULD SUGGEST SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT DEGREES OF OVERSTEPPING AT A COMMON POINT OF GARNET NUCLEATION. AGES OF GARNET FORMATION USING SM-ND GEOCHRONOLOGY WILL CONSTRAIN WHETHER GARNETS FROM BOTH TYPES OF SAMPLES NUCLEATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES CONSISTENT WITH THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OF THE EQUILIBRIUM ISOGRAD, OR AS PART OF A SINGLE OROGENIC-SCALE NUCLEATION EVENT.

THIS WILL ENABLE HIGH-NEED SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY AND OTHER AREAS NATIONWIDE TO PROVIDE THEIR STUDENTS A STRONG AND INCLUSIVE SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION. THIS, IN TURN, WILL HELP PREPARE MANY OF THESE SAME STUDENTS FOR THE STEM WORKFORCE. THIS PROJECT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY-STANISLAUS (CSU-STANISLAUS), AN HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION (HSI), INCLUDES PARTNERSHIPS WITH TURLOCK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (USD), STOCKTON USD, AND MODESTO CITY SCHOOLS. THE PROJECT WILL BE GUIDED BY SEVERAL GOALS. FIRST, OVER FIVE YEARS, THE PROJECT WILL RECRUIT AND PREPARE A DIVERSE SET OF TWENTY-FIVE (25) HIGH-QUALITY STUDENTS, WHO ARE UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS OR WHO HAVE A DEGREE, IN BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, COMPUTER SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, GEOSCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, OR PHYSICS, TO BECOME K-12 STEM TEACHERS IN HIGH-NEEDS SCHOOLS. A SPECIAL FOCUS WILL BE ON RECRUITING STUDENTS OF COLOR AND OTHER MINORITIES WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE STEM ARENA. THE SCHOLARS, WHO WOULD BE SUPPORTED FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IF A CURRENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, AND FOR ONE CREDENTIALING YEAR IF ALREADY HOLDING A STEM DEGREE, WOULD REPRESENT AN INCREASE OF TWENTY-FIVE STEM TEACHERS BEYOND CURRENT NUMBERS. SECOND, PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND CSU-STANISLAUS CURRICULA WILL PROVIDE THESE PROSPECTIVE STEM TEACHERS WITH HIGH-LEVEL STEM CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AND CULTURALLY SUSTAINING PEDAGOGIES AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP, SOCIO-EMOTIONAL LEARNING, AND ACTIVE LEARNING SKILLS AND EXPERTISE TO PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR FUTURE CLASSROOMS IN HIGH-NEEDS SCHOOLS. THIS PROCESS WILL ALSO FEATURE PREPARATION WITH RESPECT TO NATIONAL NARRATIVES, FRAMEWORKS, AND STANDARDS CONCERNING TEACHING AND STUDENT LEARNING. A THIRD GOAL IS TO DECREASE TEACHER BURNOUT AND ATTRITION RATES BY CREATING AN INDUCTION PROCESS THAT INCLUDES A PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES AIMED AT CONNECTING PRACTICING STEM TEACHERS WITH ONE ANOTHER. A FOURTH GOAL IS TO CREATE, IMPLEMENT, STUDY, SUSTAIN, AND DISSEMINATE A MODEL THAT (1) INVOLVES RESEARCH-BASED BEST PRACTICES TO PREPARE AND RETAIN PROSPECTIVE STEM TEACHERS, ESPECIALLY FROM TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS, AND (2) EMPHASIZES PEDAGOGIES THAT ATTEND TO DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION. COMPREHENSIVE MIXED-METHODS PROJECT EVALUATION WILL PROVIDE FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK. THROUGH PUBLICATIONS, CONFERENCES PRESENTATIONS, AND WORKSHOPS, INVESTIGATORS WILL PROACTIVELY DISSEMINATE PROJECT FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES TO OTHER CSU CAMPUSES AND NATIONWIDE.

MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THE SUBSURFACE ENVIRONMENT THAT PLAYS MANY CRITICAL ROLES FOR CITIES, BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS A LACK OF REAL-TIME INFORMATION. MOREOVER, COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND/OR COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF RACIAL MINORITIES ARE COMMONLY MORE EXPOSED TO MORE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAN THOSE IN THE MAJORITY POPULATION OR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGHER INCOMES. CITIES ARE IN NEED OF COST-EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE WAYS TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND PRIORITIZE INTERVENTIONS TO MANAGE THESE ISSUES. THIS RESEARCH LEVERAGES EXISTING TELECOMMUNICATION FIBER-OPTIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NEARLY UBIQUITOUS IN ALL CITIES. THE APPROACH INVOLVES A NOVEL, OPTIC FIBER, SUBSURFACE, ENVIRONMENTAL SENSOR NETWORK. THE PROJECT TARGETS LOCATIONS THAT HAVE FIBER OPTION CABLES AND THAT ARE SUBJECTED TO CERTAIN TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND HAZARDS SUCH AS SUBSIDENCE OR LAND FAILURE, LEAKING SEWER PIPES, OR POOR DRAINAGE. DATA WILL BE COLLECTED FROM SELECT LOCATIONS THAT LEVERAGE EXISTING CABLES AND SENSORS (E.G., SEWER FLOW SENSORS) OR OTHER DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS (E.G., SINKHOLES, FLOODING REPORTS, OR INVENTORY DATA FOR LANDSLIDE PRONENESS), INFORMATION THAT COMES FROM CITY PARTNERS.

IF THEY ARE PRESENT, WHICH SOLAR WIND CONDITIONS ARE MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE EMISSION OF THESE MHD WAVES? (2) IF MHD WAVES ARE PRESENT, ARE THEY OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY KHI EVOLUTION ALONG THE BBFS? IF KHI EVOLUTION IS ABSENT DURING MHD WAVE EMISSION, WHAT OTHER MECHANISMS MIGHT CAUSE THESE WAVES? HOW OFTEN AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS MHD WAVE EMISSION OCCURS WITH KHI EVOLUTION? (3) WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE MHD WAVES, FREQUENCIES, PERIODS, PHASE VELOCITIES, ETC.? DO THEY AGREE WITH THE OBSERVED ULF WAVE CHARACTERISTICS NEAR BBFS? (4) HOW DO THESE MHD WAVES AFFECT BBFS' DYNAMICS? (5) WHAT ARE THE SIGNATURES OF THESE MHD WAVES IN THE IONOSPHERE? THE TEAM WILL USE CMIT-LFM COUPLED GLOBAL MHD SIMULATIONS CODE AVAILABLE AT NASA'S COMMUNITY COORDINATED MODELING CENTER (CCMC). SIMULATION RESULTS WILL BE VERIFIED WITH OBSERVATIONS FROM THE TIME HISTORY OF EVENTS AND MACROSCALE INTERACTIONS DURING SUBSTORMS (THEMIS) AND GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS FROM THE CANADIAN ARRAY FOR REALTIME INVESTIGATIONS OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY (CARISMA).

INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES (TAKEN BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS) OFTEN FALL SHORT OF THEIR POTENTIAL DUE TO OUTDATED TEACHING METHODS, CLASSROOM PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT INCLUSIVE, AND A PAUCITY OF DIVERSE ROLE MODELS. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STEM FIELDS THAT HAVE MADE STRIDES IN DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING INNOVATIVE TEACHING APPROACHES THAT WELCOME DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES, ECONOMICS HAS LAGGED BEHIND. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ABILITY OF ECONOMICS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IS COMPROMISED. THE LACK OF DIVERSITY NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE TOPICS STUDIED BUT ALSO LIMITS THE EXCHANGE OF DIVERSE IDEAS IN THE CLASSROOM, HINDERING BROADER SOCIETAL PROGRESS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING A CLASSROOM INTERVENTION USING EVIDENCE-BASED METHODS FROM STEM EDUCATION LITERATURE, WITH THE GOAL OF BROADENING PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMICS, ENHANCING STUDENT SENSE OF BELONGING, AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AND RETENTION IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF MODULES INSTRUCTORS CAN EASILY PLUG INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES DESIGNED TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO DIVERSE ROLE MODELS AND A RANGE OF EXCITING AND RELEVANT TOPICS THROUGH PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED VIDEOS. ACCOMPANYING CURRICULAR MATERIALS, GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED ACTIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLES, WILL DEEPEN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING. THE PROJECT HYPOTHESIZES THAT THIS INTERVENTION WILL POSITIVELY INFLUENCE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ECONOMICS, STRENGTHEN THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING IN ECONOMICS AND THEIR BELIEF IN THEIR OWN ABILITIES, AND IMPROVE LEARNING, PERSISTENCE, AND RETENTION, PARTICULARLY AMONG DIVERSE STUDENTS. THE MODULES WILL ALSO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMICS INSTRUCTORS, ENABLING THEM TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER THESE EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES AND DELIVERING THEM TO THE INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS CLASSROOM, THIS TIER 1 PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE IUSE: EDU PROGRAM'S ENGAGED STUDENT LEARNING TRACK, AIMING TO IMPROVE ECONOMICS EDUCATION, ENGAGE STUDENTS THROUGH INNOVATIVE AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES, ENHANCE DIVERSITY, AND PREPARE STUDENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO FURTHERS THE NSF MISSION BY EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE ON STEM EDUCATION AND INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE US TO CONDUCT RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS, A CRUCIAL STEM FIELD, BY CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE VIBRANT AND DIVERSE ECONOMICS WORKFORCE. THIS PROJECT USES A MIXED METHODS RESEARCH APPROACH BY INCORPORATING FOCUS GROUP INPUT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT MODULES AND QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR IMPACT EVALUATION. THE PROJECT TEAM PLANS TO DEPLOY THE MODULES IN CLASSES AT VARIED TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH INSTRUCTORS. EACH INSTRUCTOR WILL HAVE A ?CONTROL? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY DO NOT USE THE MODULES AND A ?TREATMENT? SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT THE PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS THAT WILL BE USED TO COLLECT DATA ON CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS STEM IDENTITY, SELF-EFFICACY, CONNECTEDNESS AND BELONGING, AND PERCEPTIONS OF PERSISTENCE IN ECONOMICS. COMBINING THAT DATA WITH INSTITUTIONAL DATA, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL PERFORM DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES REGRESSIONS TO ANALYZE PROJECT IMPACTS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT LIES IN LEVERAGING THE EXISTING EVIDENCE ABOUT ACTIVE LEARNING AND ROLE MODELS TO CREATE A NOVEL SET OF MODULES, COMBINING DIVERSE ROLE MODELS, POLICY RELEVANCE, AND ACTIVE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO SHAPE DIVERSE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS, IDENTITY, AND PERSISTENCE. THE MODULES ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADAPTABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS, FACILITATING THEIR EASY INTEGRATION INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS CLASSROOMS. THE BROADER GOALS OF THIS PROJECT START IN THE CLASSROOM BUT EXTEND BEYOND IT, AIMING TO CREATE A PROFESSION THAT WELCOMES ECONOMISTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS TO ADDRESS SOCIETY'S CHALLENGES.

THE STUDY OF CRYSTALLIZATION HAS LED TO FUNDAMENTAL DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW WATER FREEZES TO BECOME ICE. CRYSTALLIZATION IS ALSO CENTRAL TO A WIDE VARIETY OF IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES, RANGING FROM MICROELECTRONICS TO PHARMACEUTICALS. YET, DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF CRYSTALLIZATION IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCE, MANY MYSTERIES REGARDING THE DYNAMICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION REMAIN. THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS BY WHICH CRYSTALS FORM AND TO USE THAT UNDERSTANDING TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR MAKING MACROSCOPIC SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH EXOTIC MATERIALS PROPERTIES. THE RESEARCH WILL REVEAL NEW FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR PROGRAMMABLE NANOMATERIALS OF THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD FIND APPLICATIONS IN OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS, LIGHT-HARVESTING, AND OTHER NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH PROJECT ALSO TRAINS STUDENTS IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD OF SOFT CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AND ENGAGES THE PUBLIC IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SCIENCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS DEVELOPING STUDENT-LED, STUDENT-FOCUSED SUMMER PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRACTICAL HANDS-ON TRAINING IN THE LABORATORY, WHILE ALSO PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION BY CREATING A COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS AND REINFORCING GROUP COHESION. THE TEAM IS ALSO CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH A LOCAL SCIENCE MUSEUM FOCUSED ON ENHANCING INTEREST AND SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC DRIVING FORCES THAT GOVERN THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS TO CRYSTALLIZATION, AND TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THOSE PATHWAYS TO CREATE NEW OPTICAL METAMATERIALS FROM DNA-COATED COLLOIDS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS ORGANIZED AROUND TWO SPECIFIC STUDIES. IN THE FIRST STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS EXPLORING HOW THE KINETICS OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH EMERGE FROM THE PAIR-INTERACTION POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS THE DETAILS OF THE PARENT FLUID PHASE AND THE CHILD CRYSTAL PHASE. THE RESEARCH TEAM USES AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH COMBINING DROPLET-BASED MICROFLUIDICS WITH OPTICAL MICROSCOPY TO SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFY THE FULL DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF HUNDREDS OF EXPERIMENTS RUNNING IN PARALLEL. THEY ARE ALSO DEVELOPING A SUITE OF THEORETICAL TOOLS BASED ON THE STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF MULTIVALENT INTERACTIONS, CLASSICAL NUCLEATION THEORY, AND CLASSICAL THEORIES OF CRYSTAL GROWTH TO UNCOVER MICROSCOPIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRYSTALLIZATION PATHWAYS AND TO CREATE A DATA-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF THEIR EXPERIMENTS. IN THE SECOND STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS UTILIZING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH TO CREATE RATIONAL NONEQUILIBRIUM PROTOCOLS FOR FORMING SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH PRESCRIBED STRUCTURES, WHICH COULD BE USED IN FUTURE APPLICATIONS IN PHOTONICS AND PLASMONICS. HERE THEY DRAW INSPIRATION FROM TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRACTICES, SUCH AS SLOW TEMPERATURE RAMPS, TEMPERATURE CYCLING, MULTISTEP NUCLEATION AND GROWTH PROTOCOLS, AND SEEDED NUCLEATION. WHILE EXISTING STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EXPANDING THE DIVERSITY OF STATIC STRUCTURES THAT FORM IN EQUILIBRIUM, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS WORKING TO UNDERSTAND THE RICH DYNAMICAL PATHWAYS BY WHICH THOSE STRUCTURES SELF-ASSEMBLE AND TO DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO CONTROL THOSE PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE MACROSCOPIC PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS FROM COLLOIDS.

TURBULENT MIXING RESULTS FROM COMPLEX AND CHAOTIC MOTIONS THAT SPAN A LARGE RANGE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. AS SUCH, IT IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TO MEASURE AND MODEL, YET IT HAS VAST AND IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES. IN THE OCEAN, TURBULENT MIXING CONTROLS TRANSPORT OF HEAT, FRESHWATER, DISSOLVED GASSES, AND POLLUTANTS. IT IS CRUCIAL FOR OCEAN BIOLOGY BECAUSE IT BOTH DETERMINES THE FLOW FIELD FOR THE SMALLEST PLANKTON, AND IT SETS LARGE-SCALE GRADIENTS OF NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY. IT IS ALSO CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE ENERGETICS OF THE OCEAN AND REDUCING THE UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL CIRCULATION AND CLIMATE MODELS: RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL NON-HOMOGENEITY IN DEEP-OCEAN MIXING MAY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CLIMATE; UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS THAT DRIVES THE DISTRIBUTION OF DEEP-OCEAN MIXING INTENSITY IS CRITICAL. YET EVEN AFTER A HALF A CENTURY OF EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND ITS GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION, OBSERVATIONS ARE STILL SPARSE; A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT METHODS ARE STILL NEEDED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DYNAMICAL PROCESSES THAT LEAD TO TURBULENCE, AND INFERENCES OF MIXING FROM LARGER SCALE BUDGETS. AS SUCH, THE PHYSICS OF OCEAN MIXING IS ACTIVELY STUDIED USING A VARIETY OF OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES (DIRECT MEASURE OF VELOCITY AND TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS AT THE SMALLEST (MM) SCALES, INFERENCES FROM LARGE-SCALE TURBULENT OVERTURNS, OBSERVATIONS OF NET MIXING BY PURPOSEFUL DYE RELEASE) NUMERICAL AND THEORETICAL APPROACHES, AS WELL AS LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. FINALLY, THE CONSEQUENCES OF MIXING FOR LARGER SCALE CLIMATE MODELS (WHICH DO NOT DIRECTLY RESOLVE MIXING) ARE ADDRESSED BY TURNING DYNAMICAL INSIGHTS OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WORK INTO PRACTICAL PARAMETERIZATIONS. AS A CONCRETE EXAMPLE, USING DIFFERENT MIXING SCHEMES IN NUMERICAL CLIMATE MODELS CHANGES PREDICTED TROPICAL OCEAN TEMPERATURES BY MORE THAN A DEGREE AND PREDICTED SEA LEVEL RISE BY MORE THAN 30 CM. MIXING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY PLAGUING TODAY?S MODELS WITH IMPACT OF GREAT SOCIETAL RELEVANCE.

THE GOAL OF THE SPRF PROGRAM IS TO PREPARE PROMISING, EARLY CAREER DOCTORAL-LEVEL SCIENTISTS FOR SCIENTIFIC CAREERS IN ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY OR PRIVATE SECTOR, AND GOVERNMENT. SPRF AWARDS INVOLVE TWO YEARS OF TRAINING UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS AND ENCOURAGE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS TO PERFORM INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. NSF SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE PARTICIPATION OF SCIENTISTS FROM ALL SEGMENTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, IN ITS RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES; THE POSTDOCTORAL PERIOD IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN ATTAINING THIS GOAL. EACH POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW MUST ADDRESS IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT ADVANCE THEIR RESPECTIVE DISCIPLINARY FIELDS. UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF DR. THOMAS L. GRIFFITHS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, THIS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AWARD SUPPORTS AN EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST INVESTIGATING HOW CHILDREN CAN ACQUIRE LANGUAGE SO RAPIDLY AND HOW WE CAN CREATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS WITH SIMILARLY IMPRESSIVE LEARNING ABILITIES. LANGUAGE ACQUISITION INVOLVES A COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE DATA AND THE LEARNER. SUPPOSE A LEARNER HAS BEEN TOLD THAT A GREEN TRIANGLE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A ?DAX.? A LEARNER PREFERRING SHAPE-BASED GENERALIZATIONS WOULD CONCLUDE THAT ?DAX? MEANS ?TRIANGLE,? WHILE A LEARNER PREFERRING COLOR-BASED GENERALIZATIONS WOULD CONCLUDE THAT ?DAX? MEANS ?GREEN OBJECT.? THE PROPERTIES OF THE LEARNER THAT GUIDE GENERALIZATION ARE CALLED INDUCTIVE BIASES. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH INDUCTIVE BIASES ENABLE PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE LANGUAGES SO RAPIDLY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THIS TOPIC USING COMPUTATIONAL MODELING. BY CREATING DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT INDUCTIVE BIASES, WE WILL TEST WHICH INDUCTIVE BIASES YIELD THE MOST HUMAN-LIKE LEARNING, ALLOWING US TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS GUIDE LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN HUMANS. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HUMANS LEARN, THIS RESEARCH WILL ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI). AI PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY LARGE ROLE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE, BUT CURRENT AI SYSTEMS REPLICATE HARMFUL PREJUDICES FROM THEIR TRAINING DATA. OUR APPROACH PROVIDES A WAY TO CONTROL THE INDUCTIVE BIASES OF AI SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD BE USED TO DISCOURAGE HARMFUL GENERALIZATION PATTERNS THAT CURRENT MODELS DISPLAY. THIS PROJECT PRESENTS A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH FOR MODELING INDUCTIVE BIASES AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH DATA, AND IT THEN USES THIS APPROACH IN CLASSIC SETTINGS WHERE INDUCTIVE BIASES ARE DEBATED. OUR FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON META-LEARNING, A MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE IN WHICH A MODEL IS SHOWN A VARIETY OF TASKS FROM WHICH IT AUTOMATICALLY FINDS AN INDUCTIVE BIAS THAT ENABLES IT TO LEARN NEW TASKS MORE EASILY. IN OUR APPLICATION OF META-LEARNING, WE CONTROL THE SPACE OF TASKS, THEREBY CONTROLLING THE INDUCTIVE BIAS THAT IS IMPARTED VIA META-LEARNING. WE USE THIS APPROACH TO CREATE MODELS WHICH INSTANTIATE A RANGE OF HYPOTHESIZED INDUCTIVE BIASES SO THAT WE CAN ANALYZE WHICH BIASES BEST EXPLAIN HUMAN LEARNING BEHAVIOR. WE EVALUATE THIS APPROACH IN A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, FOCUSING ON THE ACQUISITION OF QUESTION FORMATION IN ENGLISH AND SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT ACROSS LANGUAGES. FOR EACH CASE STUDY, WE ANALYZE INDUCTIVE BIASES RANGING IN SPECIFICITY FROM A GENERAL-PURPOSE PREFERENCE FOR SIMPLICITY TO DETAILED INNATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE, MOTIVATED BY LONGSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER CHILDREN NEED EXTENSIVE INNATE KNOWLEDGE TO ACQUIRE LANGUAGE. WE DEFINE THE INDUCTIVE BIASES OF INTEREST USING PROBABILISTIC MODELS AND THEN USE META-LEARNING TO INSTANTIATE THOSE BIASES IN NEURAL NETWORKS. OUR APPROACH THEREFORE COMBINES THE COMPLEMENTARY STRENGTHS OF TWO MAJOR APPROACHES TO COMPUTATIONAL COGNITIVE SCIENCE: THE CONTROLLABILITY OF PROBABILISTIC MODELS AND THE LEARNING POWER OF NEURAL NETWORKS.

ON THE ONE HAND, DIFFERENT DEVICES ARE COMBINED IN ONE HETEROGENEOUS PLATFORM SO THAT SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS (E.G., ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) CAN EXECUTE MORE EFFICIENTLY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SCALE OF DEVICES AND SYSTEMS IS GETTING MUCH LARGER. THE HETEROGENEITY AND THE MASSIVE SCALE OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND, INTERPRET, AND EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR OF EACH HARDWARE COMPONENT THAT PARTICIPATES IN APPLICATION EXECUTION. THE LACK OF EXPLAINABILITY OF EXISTING COMPUTER ARCHITECTURES CAN POTENTIALLY LEAD TO FUNCTIONAL BUGS, PERFORMANCE DRAWBACKS, SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, AND RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THIS PROJECT ADVOCATES THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING EXPLAINABLE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE BY ENHANCING COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE SIMULATORS AND DEVELOPING VISUALIZATION TOOLS THAT HELP ANALYZE PERFORMANCE ISSUES. THE RESEARCH OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT REDUCES THE BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND RESEARCH.

INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES (TAKEN BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS) OFTEN FALL SHORT OF THEIR POTENTIAL DUE TO OUTDATED TEACHING METHODS, CLASSROOM PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT INCLUSIVE, AND A PAUCITY OF DIVERSE ROLE MODELS. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STEM FIELDS THAT HAVE MADE STRIDES IN DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING INNOVATIVE TEACHING APPROACHES THAT WELCOME DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES, ECONOMICS HAS LAGGED BEHIND. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ABILITY OF ECONOMICS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS IS COMPROMISED. THE LACK OF DIVERSITY NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE TOPICS STUDIED BUT ALSO LIMITS THE EXCHANGE OF DIVERSE IDEAS IN THE CLASSROOM, HINDERING BROADER SOCIETAL PROGRESS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING A CLASSROOM INTERVENTION USING EVIDENCE-BASED METHODS FROM STEM EDUCATION LITERATURE, WITH THE GOAL OF BROADENING PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMICS, ENHANCING STUDENT SENSE OF BELONGING, AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AND RETENTION IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF MODULES INSTRUCTORS CAN EASILY PLUG INTO INTRODUCTORY ECONOMICS COURSES DESIGNED TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO DIVERSE ROLE MODELS AND A RANGE OF EXCITING AND RELEVANT TOPICS THROUGH PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED VIDEOS. ACCOMPANYING CURRICULAR MATERIALS, GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED ACTIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLES, WILL DEEPEN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING.

A CENTRAL GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION RATE OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES (REU) PROGRAMS. MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WORK FULL-TIME JOBS OR HAVE FAMILY DUTIES, PRESENTING A CHALLENGE TO PARTICIPATE IN A TRADITIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE. ADDITIONALLY, COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OFTEN CENTERED ON PROVIDING TOP QUALITY CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION, LEAVING LIMITED TIME TO GUIDE STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, EARLY RESEARCH EXPERIENCES IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES ARE LESS COMMON THAN IN SOME OTHER DISCIPLINES, WHICH MAY KEEP STUDENTS FROM DISCOVERING A PASSION FOR THE DISCIPLINE AS THEY BEGIN THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES BY ADAPTING THE PROVEN RESEARCH EXPERIENCES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES (RE-C^2) MODEL TO AN ONLINE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. THE PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RE-C^2 FORMAT AT MULTIPLE SITES NATIONWIDE BY FOSTERING COLLABORATION BETWEEN STUDENT RESEARCHERS AND FACULTY. SPECIFICALLY, EACH YEAR, FIVE TEAMS CONSISTING OF TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS, ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY, AND ONE FACULTY MEMBER FROM A 4-YEAR INSTITUTION WILL WORK TOGETHER TO EXPLORE OPEN PROBLEMS FROM ACROSS THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES. THE PROJECT WILL GIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW MATHEMATICALLY AND GAIN TECHNICAL AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS BY INTRODUCING THEM TO THE EXCITEMENT OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH. LED BY LOS ANGELES PIERCE COLLEGE, THIS EFFORT INCLUDES COLLABORATORS FROM GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY, INTER AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO, UCLA, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT ARLINGTON. DURING THEIR YEAR-LONG RESEARCH PROJECT, STUDENTS WILL ENROLL IN COURSEWORK IN LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. CONCURRENTLY TAKING THESE COURSES AND COLLABORATING ON AN ORIGINAL RESEARCH PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A RICH AND ENGAGING INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL GAIN NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MATHEMATICS AND THEIR FUTURE AT STEM LEARNERS AND PROFESSIONALS. PROJECT EVALUATION WILL USE SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO ASSESS STUDENTS? TECHNICAL, COMMUNICATION, PROBLEM SOLVING AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS, AWARENESS OF MATHEMATICS, AND IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON THE DESIRE TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL COURSEWORK AND, ULTIMATELY, A STEM CAREER. PROJECT OUTCOMES, INCLUDING STUDENT RESEARCH FINDINGS, WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PRESENTATIONS, PUBLICATIONS, AND DIRECT CONTACT WITH PEER INSTITUTIONS LOOKING TO BUILD SIMILAR PROGRAMS. THE HSI PROGRAM AIMS TO ENHANCE UNDERGRADUATE STEM EDUCATION, BROADEN PARTICIPATION IN STEM, AND BUILD CAPACITY AT HSIS. ACHIEVING THESE AIMS, GIVEN THE DIVERSE NATURE AND CONTEXT OF THE HSIS, REQUIRES INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT INCENTIVIZE INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATION AND PROMOTE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH (I) ON ENGAGED STUDENT LEARNING, (II) ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO DIVERSIFY AND INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN STEM EFFECTIVELY, AND (III) THAT IMPROVES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BUILD INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AT HSIS ARE SUPPORTED BY THIS PROGRAM.

THE FELLOWSHIP SUPPORTS RESEARCH AND TRAINING OF THE FELLOW THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE AREA OF RULES OF LIFE IN INNOVATIVE WAYS. EUROPEAN GREEN CRABS (CARCINUS MAENAS) ARE ONE OF THE WORLD?S MOST SUCCESSFUL MARINE INVASIVE SPECIES, DUE IN PART TO THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE ACROSS A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. ON THE NORTH AMERICAN WEST COAST, INVASIVE GREEN CRABS NEGATIVELY IMPACT SPECIES IMPORTANT FOR COMMERCIAL SHELLFISH PRODUCTION AND TRIBAL FOOD SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH COMPETITION WITH NATIVE CRABS, PREDATION OF JUVENILE SHELLFISH, AND DESTRUCTION OF NURSERY EELGRASS BEDS. IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD AND DAMAGES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT HELP THIS SPECIES TOLERATE TEMPERATURE CHANGES. THIS WORK WILL UNCOVER HOW GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO AN INDIVIDUAL CRAB?S TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE. THE FELLOW WILL EXPAND ON PREVIOUS JUSTICE, DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION WORK BY DEVELOPING LESSONS ABOUT GENETICS AND MARINE INVASIONS FOR UNDER-RESOURCED SCHOOLS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA. WEST COAST C. MAENAS POPULATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER GENETIC DIVERSITY THAN IN THEIR NATIVE RANGE. RECENT DISCOVERY OF A SUPERGENE (BLOCK OF GENES INHERITED TOGETHER) WITH AMINO ACID-CHANGING MUTATIONS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THERMAL TOLERANCE SUGGESTS A GENETIC BASIS FOR C. MAENAS THERMOTOLERANCE AT A POPULATION LEVEL. WHILE POPULATION-LEVEL DIFFERENCES IN THERMAL PERFORMANCE ARE IMPORTANT, THEY CAN OBSCURE THE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PHENOTYPICALLY PLASTIC TRAITS THAT INFLUENCES THERMOTOLERANCE. THE FELLOW WILL PAIR WHOLE-ANIMAL THERMAL PHYSIOLOGY, TRANSCRIPTOMICS, AND METABOLOMICS IN ADULT C. MAENAS TO DISENTANGLE THERMAL RESPONSE VARIATION ASSOCIATED WITH ACCLIMATORY PLASTICITY AND ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION. BY LEVERAGING THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING PROVIDED BY HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS UNTARGETED TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND METABOLOMICS, THE FELLOW WILL ELUCIDATE IMPACTS OF TEMPERATURE ON MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY THAT MAY NOT BE EASILY OBSERVED BY WHOLE-ORGANISM RESPONSE METRICS ALONE. MOLECULAR REPROGRAMMING IDENTIFIED BY THESE METHODS WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL THERMOTOLERANCE CONTRIBUTES TO POPULATION STRESS RESPONSES. THIS RESEARCH WILL QUANTIFY INDIVIDUAL THERMAL TOLERANCE VARIATION AND CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR DISSECTING THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNINGS OF PLASTICITY-ADAPTATION INTERACTIONS. THE METHODS CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER SYSTEMS, AND WILL EXPAND THE FELLOW?S RESEARCH BREADTH. THE FELLOW WILL PROVIDING PAID RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED GROUPS IN OCEAN SCIENCES, THUS TRAINING STUDENTS IN ECOPHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING MENTORSHIP SKILLS NECESSARY FOR THE FELLOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PROFESSOR.

IN THIS LENS, THE EXPLOITATION OF LAND IS BASED ON THE EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE, AND THE REGENERATION OF LAND DEPENDS ON THE REGENERATION OF PEOPLE. BIPOC FARMERS AND FOOD SYSTEM ACTORS HAVE FORMED REGIONAL URBAN AND REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY NETWORKS. THESE NETWORKS AIM TO RECONNECT FARMERS WITH RURAL LAND AFTER GENERATIONS OF SLAVERY, GENOCIDE, DISPLACEMENT, AND EXCLUSION, AND ARE COMMITTED TO FEEDING POOR URBAN POPULATIONS WITH HEALTHY, FRESH FOOD WITH THESE EFFORTS. WHILE THESE NETWORKS HAVE ACHIEVED A REMARKABLE LEVEL OF ORGANIZING AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING USING A GRASSROOTS APPROACH, THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED EITHER FUNDING AND/OR OTHER SUPPORT TYPES THAT HAVE PROPELLED OTHER POLICY NETWORKS INTO HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEGRATION AND ORGANIZATION. THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS PLANNING GRANT WILL PROVIDE THIS SUPPORT TO SECURE THESE NETWORKS ACCESS TO REGIONAL LAND FOR FOOD, WATER, AND ENERGY INNOVATION AND GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM TO VISION REGENERATION GOALS 25+ YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. PARTNERING WITH THE NORTHEAST FARMERS OF COLOR LAND TRUST (NEFOC) AND BLACK FARMER FUND (BFF), THIS RESEARCH TEAM WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE NEFOC SERVICE AREA TO CO-DESIGN AND BUILD A NETWORK AND FRAMEWORK FOR A COLLECTIVE IMPACT (CI) MODEL. METHODS INCLUDE BUILDING ON SURVEYS COMPLETED BY NEFOC AND BFF, CONVENING FOCUS GROUPS, AND CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS WITHIN THE COLLECTIVE IMPACT FRAMEWORK TO CREATE A COMMON AGENDA FOR THE NETWORKS USING A STRUCTURED FORM OF COLLABORATION. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL SYSTEMS, UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH BIPOC POLICY NETWORKS FOSTER THOSE SYSTEMS, AND DETERMINE THE KEY ASSETS AND GAPS TO CREATING MORE COLLECTIVE POWER IN THOSE SYSTEMS FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY. THIS PROJECT INVESTS IN BIPOC SUSTAINABILITY POLICY NETWORKS ADVANCING A REPARATIVE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK TO ADVANCE BIPOC NETWORKS INTO HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEGRATION AND ORGANIZATION, INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY FOR LAND SOVEREIGNTY, AND SUPPORT LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THESE BIPOC NETWORKS POSE NOVEL, INTEGRATIVE VISIONS, WHICH INCORPORATE ECOLOGY, CULTURE, SPIRITUALITY, HISTORY, AND GEOGRAPHY. OUTCOMES FROM THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS ENTRENCHED LEGACIES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE AND TRAUMA, WHILE REPAIRING BIPOC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LAND AND RESTORING REGIONAL ECOSYSTEMS. STRENGTHENING BIPOC SUSTAINABILITY POLICY NETWORKS IS FOUNDATIONAL TO BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHILE IMPROVING STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING REGIONAL ECOSYSTEMS.

INCLUDING HUMANS ? FROM STRESSES SUCH AS STARVATION, PATHOGENS, AND THE ACCUMULATION OF CELLULAR DEBRIS. RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH COULD LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN CROP YIELDS AS WELL AS ANIMAL AND HUMAN HEALTH. IN ADDITION TO ITS SCIENTIFIC GOALS, THIS PROJECT WILL HELP CREATE A DIVERSE AND TECHNICALLY LITERATE WORKFORCE BY PROVIDING A RESEARCH-RICH LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AT EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, A PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION THAT SERVES A RACIALLY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS. TWELVE UNDERGRADUATE AND TWO MASTER?S STUDENTS WILL BE SUPPORTED TO PERFORM CUTTING-EDGE BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH FOR 1-2 YEARS EACH. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WILL HELP SUPPORT SEMESTER-LONG, GUIDED RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR ~24 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TAKING A RESEARCH-BASED SENIOR-LEVEL BIOCHEMISTRY LABORATORY COURSE. THESE TWO ACTIVITIES WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE PRACTICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SKILLS NEEDED TO BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. THIS PROJECT USES YEAST GENETICS TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION OF THE AUTOPHAGOSOME, A DOUBLE-MEMBRANED VESICLE THAT ENVELOPS CELLULAR CARGO AND DELIVERS IT TO THE VACUOLE (OR, IN METAZOANS, THE LYSOSOME) FOR DEGRADATION. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE HAS ESTABLISHED THE PROTEINS NECESSARY FOR THIS PROCESS, MUCH REMAINS TO BE LEARNED ABOUT HOW THEY FUNCTION TO CARRY IT OUT. ONE CENTRAL PLAYER IS THE ATG8 CONJUGATION SYSTEM, WHICH ATTACHES THE SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE PROTEIN ATG8 TO THE LIPID PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, THUS DEFINING THE FORMING AUTOPHAGIC MEMBRANE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE AMOUNT OF ATG8 IN A CELL DETERMINES HOW LARGE AUTOPHAGOSOMES BECOME, BUT NOT THE NUMBER CREATED. HOWEVER, ATG7, WHICH CATALYZES THE FIRST STEP IN THE PATHWAY LEADING TO ATG8 CONJUGATION, DETERMINES BOTH THE SIZE AND THE NUMBER OF AUTOPHAGOSOMES. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE ADDITIONAL PROTEINS IN THIS PATHWAY TO RESOLVE THIS CONUNDRUM AND DETERMINE WHICH BRANCH OF THE PATHWAY AFFECTS AUTOPHAGOSOME NUMBER. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR DETAILS OF ATG11, A PROTEIN THAT ORGANIZES AUTOPHAGOSOME FORMATION AROUND AUTOPHAGIC CARGO BY BINDING TO AND ARRANGING CORE AUTOPHAGY PROTEINS. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF A REGION OF ATG11 THAT PRELIMINARY DATA HAS SHOWN TO BE CRUCIAL FOR BINDING TO ONE OF ITS KEY PARTNERS WILL DEMONSTRATE WHICH SPECIFIC RESIDUES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THIS INTERACTION. FINALLY, AN IMPROVED MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION TO ALLOW MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATION AUTOPHAGOSOME SIZE AND NUMBER FROM TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY SECTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED.
